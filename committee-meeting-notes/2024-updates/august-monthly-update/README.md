### Detailed Activities

#### Document Publications

The release of our Committee Charter and the Comprehensive Annual Budget Process document represents a major milestone in transparently defining our role and methodologies. These documents provide a clear roadmap for how the Budget Committee will operate within Cardano's decentralized governance structure.

#### Rare Evo Events

Our presence at Rare Evo allowed for direct engagement with the community. The Budget Presentation offered insights into our processes, while the Workshop provided a hands-on opportunity for stakeholders to understand and contribute to our methodologies. The recorded video of the workshop is now available, extending the reach of this valuable session to the wider Cardano community.

#### Ongoing Governance Documentation

We continue to develop and refine additional governance documents. These will further clarify the operational aspects of the committee and ensure a robust framework for decision-making and accountability.

#### Readiness Tracking

As we approach the activation of DReps and the 2025 budget evaluation process, we are actively monitoring the readiness of various Cardano entities. This proactive approach aims to ensure a smooth and effective budget allocation process once DReps are registered and operational.

### Looking Ahead

As we move into September, our focus will be on:

1. Finalizing and publishing remaining governance documents
2. Continuing stakeholder engagement and education
3. Preparing for the transition to active DRep participation in the budget process

We remain committed to fostering a transparent, efficient, and community-driven budget allocation process for the Cardano ecosystem.
