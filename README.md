## Goals of the Committee

1. Transparency: All budget-related information, including revenues, expenditures, and financial reports, is openly accessible to stakeholders. This fosters trust and accountability.
2. Collaboration: Stakeholders, including employees, partners, and sometimes the public, can contribute to the budgeting process. This input can be gathered through forums, surveys, or collaborative platforms.
3. Flexibility: The budget process should allow for adjustments and iterations based on real-time feedback and changing circumstances. This makes the budget more adaptable and responsive.
4. Community-Driven: The process should include the cardano community, and the Intersect membership.  They all should work together to develop and refine the budget.&#x20;
5. Use of Tools: Any tooling used should be visible to the Cardano Community and free to them should they need to use them.
6. Education and Training: Stakeholders are educated about the budgeting process and the tools used, enabling broader participation and better-informed contributions.
