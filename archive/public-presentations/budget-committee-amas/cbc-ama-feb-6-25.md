<summary>Session Summary:</summary>

The latest Cardano Budget Committee AMA session provided an open forum for community members to ask questions and gain clarity on the ongoing budget process. These sessions, scheduled twice a week, serve as a space for discussions on the budget structure, funding allocations, and governance. With the upcoming release of the budget figures, these conversations will become increasingly focused on analysis and refinement, allowing for direct engagement from committee members and the broader community. Plans are also in place to extend discussions beyond these AMA sessions, incorporating Cardano Forum threads, X spaces, and participation in existing community platforms such as _Cardano Over Coffee_.

A significant update from the session was the unanimous decision by the Budget Committee to delay the budget release by one more week. This delay was driven by the need for additional meetings with committees to obtain more detailed breakdowns of funding allocations. While the top-line figures have been well-reasoned, some subcategories required further clarification, particularly in areas such as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), where maintenance costs lacked granular detail. Despite frustration over the delay, committee members emphasized the importance of ensuring comprehensive documentation before making the budget public.

The session also highlighted the formation and ongoing work of the Growth and Marketing Committee, which is still in the process of structuring its foundational documents and integrating proposals from various groups, including Cardano Foundation and other ecosystem contributors. Given its early-stage development, some budget requests may require additional time before they are finalized for submission. The discussion also addressed a proposal for a potential in-person workshop, with Denver and Nairobi being considered as locations. The intent behind the workshop is to provide concentrated, face-to-face discussions on the budget, supplementing the ongoing virtual discussions.

Further clarifications were given on the upcoming net change limit proposal, which will set the maximum allowable treasury withdrawals for the year. The recommendation remains at 350 million ADA, aligning with the projected treasury replenishment rate to maintain sustainability. However, the Intersect Steering Committee requested additional review, considering alternative approaches such as a percentage-based model. Once finalized, the proposal will be made available for community feedback and subsequently put on-chain for a governance vote.

The session concluded with discussions on budget priorities, ensuring that critical infrastructure, core development, and open-source contributions remain at the forefront. The Open Source Committee (OSC) highlighted its primary budget focuses, including a maintainer retainer program, bug bounty initiatives, 24/7 security monitoring, and an improved developer support system. These initiatives aim to decentralize development efforts while maintaining the security and stability of the Cardano ecosystem.

Finally, committee members reassured the community that budget discussions will remain open and iterative, with multiple opportunities for feedback and refinement. While the first round of budgets will be released soon, additional proposals and amendments will continue to be considered throughout the year. Plans are in place for an extensive outreach campaign, ensuring that the broader Cardano community is informed and engaged in the governance process. The session reaffirmed the commitment to transparency, collaboration, and community-driven decision-making as Cardano enters a new era of decentralized governance.
