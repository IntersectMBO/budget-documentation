# DRep Knowledge Journey

Hereâ€™s a user-friendly knowledge journey for DReps to understand the Cardano budget process and their role within it. This staged approach gradually builds knowledge from basic concepts to complex processes.

In addition to the content in this knowledge journey, we strongly recommend attending our **weekly sessions** with **Lloyd Duhon**, our Subject Matter Expert. These live sessions provide a valuable opportunity to clarify complex aspects of the budget process and allow DReps to ask specific questions. Attending these sessions will complement the staged content and offer real-time support, helping members to gain deeper insights into their role within the budget process.
