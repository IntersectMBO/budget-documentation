# Technical Steering Committee

## Technical Steering Committee Budget Proposal

### Overview

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) serves as the central coordination point for Cardano's technical development, bringing together seven distinguished members who oversee the implementation of core infrastructure improvements. Led by Chair Kevin Hammond and Vice-chair Adam Dean, the TSC focuses on "Continuity" - the technical services needed to build, maintain, and enhance the core Cardano blockchain.

Working in close collaboration with the Product Committee and Core Infrastructure Roadmap (CIR) group, the TSC has developed a comprehensive technical backlog since August 2024. This backlog addresses key goals including improving dApp adoption, enhancing developer experience, maintaining Cardano's core qualities, and supporting decentralized governance implementation.

The TSC's 2025 budget proposal encompasses critical projects across multiple domains, from consensus improvements like Ouroboros Leios to infrastructure enhancements such as the Cardano Node Architecture Refresh. Notably, the committee recommends maintaining a 30% contingency for addressing emergent technical needs and security considerations throughout the year.
