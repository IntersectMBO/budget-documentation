| Topic                                | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Action Items                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smart Contract Framework Readiness   | There's a recognition that rushing the smart contract framework could be risky, especially given the values involved. A pragmatic view suggests some contracts might initially go through traditional continuity routes.                                                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Trailblazing & Learning Lessons      | The current period is seen as an early, rough "trailblazing" state. The team emphasizes learning from mistakes and iterating as long as there's continued collaboration.                                                                                                                        | Foster a collaborative environment for learning and iteration.                                                                                                                               |
| Multiple Net Change Limits (NCLs)    | The presence of numerous NCLs on-chain was a significant point of discussion. The committee debated their helpfulness or harmfulness, and the need for clear messaging to the community. Mercy suggested an emergency constitutional change for a year-long NCL to curb frequent new proposals. | Committee members to discuss and decide on official messaging regarding multiple NCLs and their impact. Consider proposing a constitutional amendment for a cool-down period on NCL changes. |
| Budget Info Action Status            | Intersect's budget info action is compiled and undergoing final checks. It is planned for submission today (May 9th) if a colleague's availability allows. It will comprise 39 proposals and be submitted as an omnibus action to maintain consistency with the Ecclesia process.               | Jack Briggs to submit the compiled budget info action today if possible.                                                                                                                     |
| NCL vs. Treasury Withdrawals Clarity | Jack Briggs clarified that a budget info action is an allocation, while the NCL is relevant to treasury withdrawals. He emphasized that the current 350 million ADA NCL is the only approved one, and future NCLs are separate. This distinction needs to be communicated to avoid distraction. | Develop clear communication to differentiate between budget info actions (allocations) and NCLs (treasury withdrawals).                                                                      |
| Community Engagement and Education   | There is concern about public perception of the NCLs and the "immaturity" of the process. The need for systematic leadership and education to convey the value of proposed budget work and the long-term benefit to the Cardano ecosystem was highlighted.                                      | Invest in educating the community on the budget process, focusing on the value and future of the ecosystem.                                                                                  |
| DREP Communication & Engagement      | Difficulty in reaching top DREPs and coordinating communication was noted. This points to a need for better communication systems for DREPs to securely interact with each other and the community.                                                                                             | Acknowledge the need for improved DREP communication systems.                                                                                                                                |
| Future Constitution Review           | The discussion touched upon the eventual need for a mechanism to review and potentially amend the constitution, moving beyond the current "set it and forget it" mentality.                                                                                                                     | Plan for future retrospectives to review and propose amendments to the constitution, potentially including NCL cool-down periods.                                                            |
| Neutrality of Intersect              | Jack Briggs emphasized Intersect's role as a neutral and impartial organization, reflecting the general will of the ecosystem even if outcomes are not universally popular. He noted that current over-caution stems from lack of mature tooling and experience.                                | Maintain Intersect's neutral stance while effectively communicating trade-offs and rationale behind budget decisions.                                                                        |
| Lessons Learned & Path Forward       | The meeting served as a reflection on the challenges encountered. The team committed to moving forward, working together to find solutions, and acknowledging the absence of a "playbook."                                                                                                      | Lloyd Duhon to publish the agenda for Monday's meeting and welcome additional items.                                                                                                         |
