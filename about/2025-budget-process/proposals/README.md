# Proposals

### Overview

The following proposals represent the culmination of extensive collaboration between Intersect's core committees, its membership base of over 2,000 contributors, and the broader Cardano community. Each proposal has been carefully developed through structured committee work, community consultations, and iterative refinement based on ecosystem feedback.

### Development Process

Each committee proposal is developed through:

* Regular committee working sessions
* Open feedback forums with Intersect members
* Community AMA sessions
* Integration of survey responses
* Collaboration with subject matter experts
* Alignment with Cardano's strategic objectives
* Consideration of ecosystem-wide priorities
