# Weekly Catchup \[21/10/2024]

The Budget Committee discussed three main topics:

1. Dubai Presentation Plans:

* The Committee plans to present a proposed Treasury withdrawal range of 300-500 million ADA
* The presentation will outline high-level goals and committee work types, without specific budget allocations
* There was discussion about managing the withdrawal's impact on ADA price
* The plan involves gradual conversion to fiat/stablecoins rather than a single large conversion
* Historical data suggests Treasury withdrawals have not significantly impacted ADA price

2. Technical Consortium Discussion:

* A proposal was discussed regarding a technical consortium involving IOG and 15-20 partner companies
* Questions were raised about how this would integrate with Technical Steering Committee (TSC) decision-making
* Key concerns included:
  * Process for adding new engineering suppliers
  * Management of engineering hours allocation
  * Relationship between consortium and TSC authority
* The committee agreed more documentation and clarification is needed

3. Treasury Working Group:

* Discussion of forming a treasury working group including experts from different organizations
* Agreement to include regular reporting to the Budget Committee
* Plans to engage multiple auditors for financial and treasury management
* Focus on transparency and communication with the broader community

Additional points covered included discussion of onboarding new members and the decision to rely on a code of conduct rather than NDAs for managing confidential information.
