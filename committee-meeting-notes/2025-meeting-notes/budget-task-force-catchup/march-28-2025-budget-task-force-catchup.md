A regular catchup to discuss the status of:

* Plans for reconciling and finalizing budget proposals.
* Development of a **smart contract–based treasury management solution**.

***

#### 3. Key Discussion Points

**3.1 Updates on Budget Proposals & Timeline**

* **Proposal Submissions:**
  * **22 proposals** received so far; more expected soon.
  * IO and CDC proposals are anticipated early next week.
  * Submission form remains open; proposals can still be added but will have cutoffs for each budget cycle.
  * Proposals to be **published on Monday**, enabling community review prior to the 15th, when a formal upvote/downvote mechanism (with DREP identification) will go live.
* **Committee Review & “Rogue” Proposals:**
  * Committees (e.g., Marketing Committee) are putting forward coordinated proposals.
  * Concern raised about how to differentiate “official” committee proposals from individual or “rogue” submissions.
  * Plan to have committees label which proposals they endorse (or do not support), so DREPs have clearer guidance.
* **Reconciliation Phase & Workshops:**
  * Community and committee feedback will culminate in **reconciliation workshops**.
  * Preliminary survey feedback on whether these should be in-person or virtual is being summarized; a more detailed proposal will be presented Monday.
  * **Earliest** possible date for budget-related **treasury withdrawals** could be **June 3**, subject to the required on-chain Info Action period (six epochs).
  * Potential to ship an “early” budget for strongly supported items while allowing more time for contentious or complex proposals.
* **Communications & Engagement Schedule:**
  * A consolidated schedule of all community touchpoints is in development.
  * Aim to leverage Intersect committees and hubs for outreach, educational materials, and gathering feedback.
  * An **Intersect Knowledge Base** page will host FAQs, educational content, and relevant links in multiple languages.

***

**3.2 Net Change Limit (NCL) Discussion**

* Two net change limit proposals currently exist:
  1. One that **covers both 2025 and 2026**.
  2. One from the Budget Task Force that **covers only 2025** (350M ADA).
* By constitutional language, “**the then applicable**” net change limit is whichever passes most recently and meets constitutional thresholds.
* Concerns exist about confusion arising from multiple NCL actions. The older 2025–26 NCL has low voter engagement (\~15% support); the single-year 2025 NCL is performing better.
* **Next Steps**:
  * Focus on ensuring the 2025 NCL action passes.
  * Consider a **separate 2026 NCL** proposal once 2025 is resolved to avoid adding complexity for DREPs.
  * Clarify final interpretation of net change limit overrides (pending Constitutional Committee confirmation).

**3.3 Smart Contract Treasury Administration**

* **Objective:** Develop a smart contract framework that administers vendor payments in line with the approved budget, including:
  * Secure multi-signature review/approval.
  * Integration with an Intersect “contracting process.”
  * Auditable records and compliance with financial regulations.
* **Operation Model**:
  * **Auto-Pay** (funds released automatically at intervals) vs. **Manual-Pay** (milestone proof required before payment) under review.
  * Must also accommodate **fiat-rail payments** and currency conversions for jurisdictions where crypto payments are not viable.
* **Development Collaboration**:
  * IO is contracting a developer for the on-chain elements.
  * Volunteers from Budget Committee (and CF for technical or regulatory viewpoints) are needed to define detailed requirements.
  * A user-friendly interface to handle proposals, payments, and audits is essential.

4. **Net Change Limit Clarifications:**
   * Seek formal interpretation from the ICC (Constitutional Committee) on “the then applicable” language and confirm that the latest valid NCL supersedes previous.
   * Budget Task Force to continue outreach and communications to support passing of the 2025 NCL.
5. **Smart Contract Treasury Management Requirements:**
   * Volunteers from Budget Committee and CF to refine user flows, define key parameters (auto-pay vs. manual-pay), and ensure multi-currency compatibility.
   * Prepare a solution demo for feedback once initial development is ready.
6. **Educational & FAQ Materials:**
