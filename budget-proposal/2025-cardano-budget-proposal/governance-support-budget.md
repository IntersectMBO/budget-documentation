<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Description</th><th width="192">ROI</th><th>Total request</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constitutional Committee sub-bucket</td><td>This group is to fulfil the following projects:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Constitutional Committee Compensation</td><td>Each Constitutional Committee (CC) member dedicates significant hours to evaluating incoming governance actions, verifying they comply with the Cardano Constitution. Their role demands specialized expertise—spanning legal, technical, and community-focused perspectives—and requires well-documented rationales alongside timely on-chain votes. This monthly compensation of 6000 ADA recognizes both the depth of their responsibility and the swift, consistent commitment needed to uphold constitutional integrity. By fairly compensating these experts, we help ensure transparent, high-quality decision-making in Cardano’s governance process.</td><td>Support CC members in performing their duties</td><td>₳504,000</td></tr><tr><td>Interim Constitutional Committee legal advisory</td><td>This allocation for legal advisory ensures newly appointed Constitutional Committee (CC) members can receive professional counsel on matters like entity formation and liability protection. Because the process of joining the CC may involve navigating varying legal frameworks, these funds are set aside to cover potential incorporation or compliance costs. By ensuring each member’s legal footing is secure, we protect both the individual and the broader governance structure from unforeseen complications. Critically, this budget item is a contingency measure, used only if and when new members require legal assistance.</td><td>Support CC members in setup</td><td>₳160,000</td></tr><tr><td>CC Contributor Reimbusement</td><td>This budget line item supports a set of operational and technical roles that ensure the Constitutional Committee (CC) can effectively fulfill its governance responsibilities. These roles provide administrative, logistical, and technical support to maintain smooth decision-making processes and secure technical participation. Key responsibilities include coordinating meetings, managing documentation, tracking governance decisions, and facilitating communication between the CC and other governance bodies.
