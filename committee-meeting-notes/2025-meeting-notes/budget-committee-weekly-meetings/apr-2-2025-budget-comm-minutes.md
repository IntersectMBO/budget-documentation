## Decisions/Actions

\


| Topic                                           | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Action Items                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budget Proposal Publication & Review            | All proposals are now published on Gov tool, with new submissions automatically added. Work remains to reconcile proposals submitted previously to committees and to conduct a gap analysis for missing items. New proposals (e.g., IO's research proposals) are expected in the next 24 hours.                          | Reconcile previously submitted proposals with current Gov tool entries and perform a gap analysis.                                              |
| Delegation-Weighted Voting                      | Delegation-weighted voting on Gov tool will be turned on soon, allowing DREPs' votes to be tracked and filtered by DREP and committee comments.                                                                                                                                                                          | Activate delegation-weighted voting on Gov tool.                                                                                                |
| Knowledge Base & Communications                 | A single landing page on the Intersect website is being created to centralize all budget-related information, educational materials, and FAQs. All future communications will direct users to this page.                                                                                                                 | Finalize and update the knowledge base on the Intersect website as a central landing page for budget information.                               |
| Net Change Limit (NCL) Monitoring & Contingency | Both NCLs currently on-chain are showing similar levels of support. Contingency planning has begun to address scenarios where both NCLs fail, or one passes while the other doesn't, to ensure forward movement.                                                                                                         | Begin contingency planning for various NCL scenarios (failure, partial pass).                                                                   |
| Smart Contract & Treasury Management Solution   | The first phase of on-chain elements for the smart contract treasury management solution has been delivered. A demo is being prepared. Detailed requirements for the next phases (application for administrators/key holders/vendors, public dashboard) are being gathered, with a kick-off call scheduled for tomorrow. | Prepare and share a demo of the smart contract solution. Continue gathering detailed requirements for the next phases (application, dashboard). |
| Vendor Submissions & Open APIs                  | Over 75 vendor proposals have been submitted, with more expected from IO, CDC, and Catalyst. Documentation for Gov tool's open APIs is being finalized and will be released this week, enabling Tempo and other community tools to integrate and build their own assessment tools.                                       | Release Gov tool API documentation to the public this week.                                                                                     |
| Committee Proposal Submission Process           | Discussion on how committees (e.g., Catalyst, MCC) are submitting their line items. The current recommendation is for committees/vendors to submit net new proposals via the new form (which uses URLs for attachments instead of direct uploads) to reduce backend workload for Intersect.                              | Communicate the updated process for submitting proposals (using URLs for attachments) to committees and vendors.                                |
| Reconciliation Process Planning                 | Danielle presented a high-level overview of the proposed reconciliation process, seeking committee input and feedback. The process aims to move from proposals on Gov tool to a draft budget info action for on-chain submission.                                                                                        | Committee to provide feedback on the proposed reconciliation process.                                                                           |
| Budget Info Action Threshold                    | A key outstanding question for the committee is defining the threshold for proposals to be included in the Budget Info Action (BIA). This includes determining whether it should be based on a number of DREPs or a stake-weighted number, reflecting sufficient community support.                                      | Define the threshold (number of DREPs or stake-weight) for proposals to be included in the BIA.                                                 |
| Budget & Treasury KPIs                          | The committee discussed including benchmarks in the governance info action (e.g., treasury transaction volume, number of entities funded) to track the effectiveness of treasury spend over time. This aims to kick the full KPI discussion down the road to 2026.                                                       | Discuss and decide on initial benchmarks (e.g., transaction volume, entities funded) to include in the BIA.                                     |
| Virtual Reconciliation Workshops & Facilitation | Reconciliation workshops will be virtual and facilitated by Voltage Control (who helped with SIP 1694). The proposed schedule includes an initial overarching orientation workshop (April 10th) followed by topical proposal review sessions.                                                                            | Confirm dates and agenda for the initial virtual workshops.                                                                                     |
| Workshop Topic Ordering                         | Initial proposal for workshop topic order: Governance & No Category, then Marketing & Innovation, then Core & Research. This aims to distribute volume and allow more time for controversial/technical topics.                                                                                                           | Finalize the order of topics for the proposal review workshops.                                                                                 |
| Budget Committee Meeting Schedule               | The committee's Monday meetings might conflict with upcoming workshops. A suggestion to move meetings to Tuesdays for April was raised.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Discuss and decide on rescheduling Budget Committee meetings to Tuesdays for April.                                                             |
