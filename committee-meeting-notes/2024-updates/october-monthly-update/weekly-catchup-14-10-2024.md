### Notes

The budget committee meeting was held on October 14, 2024 to discuss several key items related to the 2025 Cardano budget preparation and presentation:

1. The committee discussed the need to work with various committees to collect budget numbers in ADA and create a fiat view of budgets. They agreed to start the process to explore the creation of a Treasury working group under the Budget Committee to manage ADA approved by governance bodies.
2. There were discussions about ongoing work with founding entities and existing contractors to finalize certain budget numbers, with emphasis on the need for detailed breakdowns rather than just large total figures. The committee stressed the importance of having reasonably accurate numbers before the Dubai presentation.
3. The possibility of including 2025 Cardano Summit funding in the 2025 budget was discussed. It was suggested that the marketing working group should include an allocation for this, potentially covering multiple smaller summits worldwide rather than one large event.
4. The committee discussed fulfilling the original request from July for observer and voting rights from representatives of Emurgo. They agreed to invite them as observers immediately, with potential voting rights to be granted later alongside other new voting members.
5. The structure of the Dubai pitch deck was briefly reviewed, including sections on purpose, plans, budget buckets, treasury withdrawal, and budget management processes.
6. Social media channels for the committee were presented for approval, with some discussion on branding and naming conventions.
7. There were brief mentions of potential tools for milestone tracking and budget management, with suggestions to explore existing solutions used in the ecosystem.

The meeting highlighted the ongoing work to prepare a comprehensive and transparent budget presentation for the Cardano community, balancing the need for accuracy with time constraints ahead of the Dubai event.
