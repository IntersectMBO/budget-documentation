In the Cardano budget process, the budget is divided into five primary "buckets," each with a specific purpose aligned with Cardano’s strategic and operational goals:

1. **Core Development**: Funds essential operations and technical improvements, maintaining and expanding Cardano’s core blockchain features.
2. **Governance Support**: Provides resources for governance structures, including DReps and Constitutional Committee activities, to uphold Cardano's decentralized governance.
3. **Research**: Supports ongoing blockchain research and innovation.
4. **Outreach and Education**: Promotes Cardano through educational programs, community engagement, and global outreach to expand adoption and understanding.
5. **Community Grants**: Allocates funds for community-led projects and initiatives, to foster ecosystem growth through decentralized innovation.

Each bucket is strategically defined to ensure Cardano’s continued development, governance, and community involvement in a balanced and impactful way.
