2. Scope&#x20;

We will use Zoom to manage the meetings. Following the weekend's Twitter posts, our original scope has been overtaken. The first couple of sessions will now be AMA-style.

## How will committees present their scope?

The budget committee's purpose in November was to set up socialization sessions with the CC/DReps so they could start understanding the scope of each committee's delivery in 2025. &#x20;

* Are the committee happy with each committee creating a deck outline scope?
* The cost of delivery will be asked, and how does the committee propose to manage this?&#x20;
* The budget committee would note the session.&#x20;
* The goal is to gain approval from DReps on the work to progress in 2025.

## Requests not from a committee?

We have always envisaged that the the majority of the scope would be supplied by committees. However, an ask from a company or member who has not worked with a committee may arise.

How would the committee like to manage these?

**Option 1**: Review the scope and advise which elements of their ask should be taken to which committee or raise an appropriate request to CC/DReps.

**Option 2:** The budget committee reviews and accepts the budget as requested by the budget committee.

**Option 3**: Reject the request and ask them to raise it directly to the CC/DReps.

**Unanimous decision** to proceed with Option 1\
