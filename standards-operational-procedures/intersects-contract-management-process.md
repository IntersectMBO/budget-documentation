# Intersect's Contract Management process

Here, you will find an overview of how Intersect's Operational Services will manage contracts and committee budgets.

### **Introduction** <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The purpose of Intersect’s Operational Services is to support committee projects by managing contract processes and overseeing the budget. Our approach ensures compliance, transparency, and effective management of resources, enabling committees to focus on their objectives. **This process will be implemented from January 2025.**

### Budget Management <a href="#budget-management" id="budget-management"></a>

The Budget Committee is responsible for ensuring that the community-approved budget is effectively managed, tracked, and delivered according to mandates. While they oversee these budgets, Intersect’s Core Services team handles the operational day-to-day expenditures. Their key responsibilities include:

* **Budget Sheet Management**: Each committee has a dedicated budget sheet tracking expenditures.
* **Procurement & Delivery Tracking**: Monitoring each phase of contract completion.
* **Legal & Invoicing Support**: Managing contracts, invoicing, and financial documentation.
* **Forecasting & Reporting**: Ensuring transparency and financial accountability

### **Contract & Bid Management**

Intersect Core Services team oversees the entire bid and contract management process, from initial proposals to final completion. They work closely with each committee to ensure clear communication, tracking, and timely project delivery.

The Core Services team facilitates each phase of the bid and contract lifecycle.  Below is a diagram of how the process works.

### **Proposal Evaluation**

Community members are welcome to volunteer to support the evaluation of a bid, provided they meet the following criteria:

* Member of Intersect
* Have applied to be an evaluator through the agreed process (TBC)
* Member of the Committee, if the Committee has decided to evaluate internally for particular circumstances (e.g. TSC)

These members will constitute the evaluation review board (yet to be defined).

### Contract Management <a href="#contract-management-1" id="contract-management-1"></a>

Once all parties have signed a contract, the Intersect Delivery Assurance team will manage the contract.

### Financial Transparency

To ensure transparency, Intersect has proposed a quarterly meeting be held with the CC/DReps.  At these meetings, the Committees, supported by Intersect Core Services, would walk the audience through the financial details and value delivered during the period.\
