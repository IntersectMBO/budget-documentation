Development: Finance development by companies like Aiken, FluidTokens, TxPipe, AnastasiaLabs, HarmonicLabs, DcSpark, SundaeLabs, among many other dev teams & individuals. Utilize Retroactive funding + grant comittes on missions as Optimism, as opposed to Catalyst system which is more chaotic. Good report about this in here https://rebrand.ly/Grant-Report_StormPartnersXCatalyst

R&D: Not an expert on the subject, but I think IOG proved big success and coordination, and they deserve to be part of future R&D efforts, but alongisde new players coming form different cardano or wide crypto projects.

Innovation & grants: Not sure what to do here. Catalyst is cool, but if all money must come from treasury would be a huge burden and treasury will deplete in 5 years or so. Maybe finding a solution of 10-25M per fund + deploy some capital through VC or commercial arms allocation (as COTI or NMKR did in the past) with some equity involved. Or else, allocate RFP (retroactive funding programs) on Catalyst with Development & Marketing budgets onto Catalyst, as mentioned in the report above.

Marketing & ecosystem growth: I'd highly focus on education + video content. Documentation is also important, and the community is doing a good job around this. But high-quality education is much needed for people to see Cardano's value proposition.
I think to get adoption we need to embrace viral content on social media, and make learning interesting by explaining complex, important concepts (liquid staking, eutxo determinism, treasury system, on-chain governance, etc) in a simple easy to understand manner.
Marketing for me is important, and will definitely allocate some percentage of the budget, but no more than 10%, as there's other priorities, for example onboarding big projects that will allow the community to do the marketing on itself, or Ouroboros Leios & Peras going on development and mainnet, or Hydra tooling and finalization for mass adoption, or on-chain governance and wallets being as easy and smooth as possible for normies. All this, will allow Cardano to be marketed a lot easier in 2-5 years time than today.",,,5% - 10%,"All of the above, I think most of the people out there will take their decisions based on what their preferred DRep/Content creator/SMEs think. So internal dicussions and workshop are essential for the core contributors, but we also need to focus on curating that content and discussions into valuable insights and easy-to-understand rationale for why we think X or Y is the correct solution for a certain problem (e.g. in this case, why we believe R&D should be prioritized over marketing in the first 2 years, or the opposite if somebody believes so). I think this is the way to increase community participation & engagement on complex topics like an annual budget for Cardano. This job should be done by DReps and/or Intersect working groups, and some compensation must be put in place in order to get the best quality-content out there.",Unsure/I don’t know,5,Somewhat familiar,"Support and enhance https://tempo.vote/ app. Improve UX, add seedless registration, multiple-wallet voting stake, etc. 

Scaling: Ouroboros Leios paper is already published and reviewed, and it should be a top priority for Cardano community in my opinion. Hydra implementations also would be ideal to focus on.

Education: Develop educational content in a structured way. A lot of people want to learn and get involved in Cardano, but information is scattered around and incomplete or difficult to follow. I'd like to see a place where clear career paths can be taken, and a newbie could come and go from not knowing about programming, cryptography and blockchain, to being an expert on Aiken for example. Or a path for innovators and entrepreneurs to easy understand Catalyst processes, or how to raise funding for a web3 product. I'm thinking of a Platzi (https://platzi.com/) but Cardano and web3 related.","I'm not sure of which areas exists as of right now, apart Catalyst. I'd diminish the funding to around 25M per fund for now, or at least I'll partially redesign the system with a RFP initiative, focusing the innovation in key-development areas determined by SMEs and the Cardano community as a whole (e.g Scaling solutions, Wallet UX improvements, etc). Combine current catalyst system with a more expert-led approach as Optimism does.
","Again, I'm not sure how Cardano's treasury is being managed for other uses apart from Catalyst funding (and intersect funding?), so I don't have much to add here. Maybe more efforts into showcasing Cardano's treasury management must be put into place.","Long-term sustainability for sure. We know that most of the treasury's revenue comes from monetary expansion, and transaction fees are yet a pretty small portion of it. We cannot assume that transaction fees alone will allow us to self-sustain 5 years from now. If we want to keep ADA capped at 45B, we need to have a conservative and wise spending of treasury resources, specially during a moment where ADA is valued at .3 cents, and +80% down from ATH. Otherwise, if we spend like there's no tomorrow, treasury will get depleted in 5-15 years, and we'll be forced to change our core vision of sound money, and transform ADA into an inflationary asset. This may not be the end of the world, and a conservative 1-2% inflationary currency that will allow to fund Cardano's future may not be the worst idea, but if the community doesn't want this, then conservative spending must be considered.","No, but would like to",Monthly,Both high-level and detail,"Email newsletters, Social media platforms, Community forums, All the above","Focus on giving rationale to the common mortals as to why decisions are being made the way they are.

3,"End user, Researcher",2 - 5 years,Intermediate,1,3,5,4,,,1,3,5,4,,2,"To support the rapid implementation of nation state blockchain voting and create a more meaningful culture, I believe Cardano should consider integrating the following technologies and platforms:

1. Interoperable Governance Frameworks: Cardano could develop a modular governance framework that facilitates interoperability with existing governmental systems and other blockchain networks. This would enable the seamless adoption of blockchain voting across various jurisdictions, empowering citizens to engage in governance without disrupting current structures.

2. Enhanced Identity Solutions: As Cardano advances its identity solutions, particularly with the upcoming Midnight sidechain, it should focus on multi-dimensional verification methods that could integrate biometric, social, and historical data. This enhancement will bolster trust in the voting process, ensuring eligible participation while safeguarding privacy.

3. Blockchain-Based Impact Assessment Tools: Developing tools for communities to assess the impact of their voting decisions over time can create valuable feedback loops. This encourages informed participation, enabling citizens to see the direct effects of their votes, thereby fostering accountability and continuous improvement in governance processes.

4. AI-Driven Insights and Recommendations: Leveraging AI technologies to analyze voting trends, predict community needs, and optimize engagement strategies could enhance decision-making within the Cardano ecosystem. AI can ensure that governance remains responsive to evolving community needs, addressing challenges and opportunities proactively

By adopting these technologies or similar, Cardano can play a pivotal role in re-engineering our societal structures and unlocking our potential as a species. The integration of innovative governance solutions, enhanced identity verification, and responsible AI-driven insights will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of blockchain voting while nurturing a culture of active participation and social responsibility.

I'm skeptical of marketing because Cardano can market itself once people open their hearts and minds. We can't do that for them. "," integration and optimization of Decentralized digital identity across all aspects of Cardano. This combined with zero knowledge proofs really paves the way to decentralize nation states and re-engineer our entire civilization with caution and safety.

The ability for interoperability and seamless transition from traditional systems will be fundamental to making this possible. ","I think there are challenges outside the control of budget. We have to come together as a community, encourage a belief in optimistic and positive goals to help Cardano be the catalyst for civilizational progress that it has set out to be. 

We need to encourage less focus on accumulation of wealth and stand by our conviction in creating valuable tools that are accessible to all of humanity to help each of us actualize our potential and benefit mutually. 

I hope to continue to learn and find ways to better actualize this through action, and be the change I want to see in an ecosystem I have truly come to love. I hope to further my education and do my best to contribute more to Cardano then I did yesterday.

1. Add the following clause to the Cardano Constitution:

- Budget principles must be approved by more than 50% of the DRep in an information governance action.
- The Cardano Budget 2025 must be created in accordance with those budget principles.

・ステーブルコインをカルダノチェーンで送付できるようにしたらかなりの需要があると思う。
■理由■
よく送金スピードが速いことをアピールするコイン（solanaなど）があるが、
着金スピードが数秒で終わるものは、店舗支払いなどでは有効だとは思う。
しかし、その他の場合は1分ぐらいで終わるのであれば、その差は大して気にはならないし、
むしろ安全で確実に着金することの方が重要になるから。

トランザクションが失敗しているのにも関わらず手数料が取られるETHなどは、
そもそも使えないのでレイヤー2になるが、その際も停止トラブルがあるため少額であれば
便利だが大きな資金は不安がある。

そこで、失敗時に手数料も取られず、手数料の金額を安定していて、過去に停止したことがない
カルダノはかなりの需要があると思う。

一般社会での採用も停止するコインは正直不安なので堅実な企業は採用しづらい。
流行りにのっかる企業や、セキュリティ面の認識が甘い企業などは流行りのコインを採用すると
思われるが、長期で考えた場合は安定している方が確実に望ましいと思う。
カルダノはそこが他のコインと違い圧倒的に優位性が高いので、長期目線でアピールしてほしい。

例えば大きな資金を動かす際に、突然停止してしまうようなsolanaチェーンは使いたくない。
ETHチェーンは手数料が高すぎるのと、失敗時でも支払い発生するので使えない。
レイヤー2は手数料は安いが停止などの問題があるため若干不安がある。
そうなるとカルダノチェーンでステーブルコインを送金するのが一番安心になる。


・学生証明書以外での証明関連の採用（選挙での投票※まずは小さい地域から、資格証明、コンサートや映画などのチケット証明、家電製品などの保証書、ブランド品の本物証明※製品にQRコード、企業と顧客間の締結書などの証明書、工作機械のパーツの生産元証明書、募金関連の透明性アップ、1トランザクションで複数送金ができるのを生かした暗号資産での給料払い）
■重要だと思うこと■
アルゼンチンなど関係性のいいところでの採用や検討を開始して、とにかく多くの成功実績をつくるべきだと思います。
ただ提携しただけでなく、その後の進捗などの報告もすることで実績（★超重要★：実用前と採用後の改善できた具体的な数値の発表）や実用性をアピールすることで採用したい企業などを増やす。
現在の一般的なユースケースとして有識者はステーキングやDefi，NFTなどがありますが、
一般の人はＥＴＦやトレード、資産として保有するぐらいなので、他のコインよりも早く実社会での採用をして
シェアを奪われないようにしたい。

カルダノは開発がしっかりと行われていて、一番重要なセキュリティ面が強いのに
いまいち理解されていない部分があるため、セキュリティの強さや送金の安定性をアピールしてほしい。
ここをちゃんと認識してもらわないと採用してもらえないと思う。

理由：失敗したら即時に運営に影響がでる。
大衆はレートを上げるために流動性アップのためにファンド関連のものに投資したいというが、信用できる人できない人に限らず成功するかが分からないので、莫大な資金を提供すること自体がリスクリワードが悪すぎる。

・資金提供の上限も決めるべき
理由：万が一変な提案が採用された場合のリスク管理にもなるから。
問題となったファンド系の提案が通った場合に、誰かが持ち逃げなどをした時点で即カルダノの資金源に問題がでてきて、取り返しのつかないことになってしまっているだろう。
起きてからじゃ遅いのでそうならないような対策が必須。

・資金の分割提供の実施
理由：カタリストの提案をみていると、進捗状況が分らないのが一番問題。
やる前に夢物語はいくらでもかける。
進捗状況をアップできないところへの資金提供の禁止。
また、進捗に合わせた分割した資金提供したほうがいい。
一括で資金提供してもらえるので詐欺っぽい提案が大量に出てくると思う。

・提案者のブラックリスト制をつくるべき
理由：例えば日本の提案はリワードが考えにくく、とても私用的な提案やカタリストの資金を狙ったような提案が多い。そういった提案が問題視されるが通ってしまうところがある。
こういったのを防ぐためにもある一定数問題視されたら提案ができなくなるようなシステムや、保有者全員に意見を求めていいかどうかを判断してもらい、提案リストにだしていいかどうかの審議も必要だと思う。
例えばレストランの開業資金で約2500万ぐらいの提案が通ってしまっている。
それも現在どうなってるかもわからないし、店舗に来たお客さんがカルダノのことを教えてほしいなどになるとは考えにくい、秘密鍵をもってきたら色々と教えると書いてあったのも犯罪に繋がる可能性が高いのに通ってしまっているという現実。
こういった問題のある提案者の排除は必須だと思う。

Projects like Project Catalyst are positive steps, but we could do more to keep the community updated on project progress and outcomes. Regular updates, detailed reports, or public dashboards showing project statuses could build trust and foster engagement. By incorporating performance-based budgeting, we could further refine our funding criteria to emphasize outcomes and impact, motivating projects to achieve tangible results that align with Cardano's goals. Additionally, adopting dynamic funding models would allow flexibility, setting aside portions of the budget for emerging technologies or unexpected opportunities as they arise.

A few key areas deserve focused funding. Balancing innovation with practical applications could ensure we support both cutting-edge projects and real-world solutions. Expanding funding in areas like liquidity, DeFi, and interoperability can enhance Cardano's ecosystem and support user adoption. To accelerate development, resources for developer tools, documentation, and possibly developer incentives would be beneficial. Increasing investment in marketing and education could raise Cardano's visibility and encourage grassroots adoption.

A preparation period of approximately four months should be allocated to gather and consolidate input from all departments. This timeline allows for comprehensive stakeholder engagement and thoughtful consideration of departmental needs.

Standardized Format
Implementation of a unified format facilitates seamless interdepartmental collaboration and ensures consistency in budget reporting and analysis.

AI Implementation Opportunities

The budget management process can be enhanced through AI applications in the following areas:

Predictive Analytics
AI can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasting and future predictions, enabling more informed financial planning decisions.

Data-Driven Insights
AI systems can provide valuable insights based on data analysis, supporting better decision-making processes across all organizational levels.

Real-Time Monitoring
Implementation of AI-powered real-time monitoring systems enables immediate detection of anomalies and facilitates prompt corrective actions.

By integrating these elements, organizations can establish a more transparent and efficient budget management system that leverages both human expertise and technological capabilities.",Asia,,I agree,5

3) Fixes to parameter issues and critical issues with staking: implementation of K = 1000, a0, min variable fee, sticky stake/stake stuck in retired pools, disabling the ability to oversaturate a pool when staking, the issue of decentralization via actual K vs intended K - currently 70% of all stake is controlled by 30% of the pools, this means that 500 individual pools are not being supported by the network - actual K is around 280. Some of these issues can be fixed with: Pool portfolios or a preferential pool selection list where delegators pick 3 stake pools instead of one (in case one retires), if/then programming for staking to solve for things like: when a pool becomes saturated, retired, or pledge not met. An open line of communication between delegators and their SPO via wallets. 

4) Lower the cost required to send NFTs -> this currently always needs at least 1ADA attached and seems to be either to generate artificial ADA volume moving on the chain, or as a form of spam protection. This gets expensive from a developer perspective, especially in growing countries like Africa. When ADA increases in price, this will be very unaffordable. We should be looking at pricing this cost as the same price as what the tx fees are if this is really necessary, so around ~0.20 ADA

5) Cardano advertising with value for money in mind - focus on the benefits of Cardano and direct builders and investors where to go to get started.

6) An alternative platform to gov.tools - mine is already broken, I can't vote and this hasn't been fixed and no reply has been sent from my email.

7) Providing ADA pooling tools to the community so that we can get real participation in Cardano governance. 100K ADA is a huge paywall barrier, and we are already seeing that hardly anyone is submitting proposals because of this. Spam protection should not debilitate governance completely, and DReps are very under utilized with only 5 proposals submitted for governance. Now that the ADA price is increasing and we are seeing the start of a bull market, this barrier will only increase and 100K ADA will soon be a 100K USD barrier, then a 200K USD barrier, and unless this barrier is accounted for with a pegging to a currency other than ADA you will be pricing out everyone except the wealthy - not what the Cardano vision stands for. ADA pooling tools integrated in gov.tools would allow for the community to gather behind proposals they want to support and would actually drive people to care about governance on Cardano. We want to lead by example, and Catalyst is already doing much better than Intersect with 25 ADA as a minimum balance required to vote in F13. It is clear that lessons have not been learned from what Catalyst has accomplished, and I feel we are re-inventing the wheel into a square shape :(

8) Bitcoin OS collaboration and supporting other builders working to solve for Bitcoin+Cardano integration, like FluidTokens. Help them to achieve full interoperability on chain for Bitcoin on Cardano so Bitcoin users can experience all the benefits of Cardano and Cardano gets the tx volume, fees, and adoption from the Bitcoin ecosystem. Advertising could help in this area as well.

9) Proper implementation and support for DIDs where they are needed, like with voting so that we can incorporate Quadratic Voting for governance and Catalyst. This would achieve the Cardano vision better than 1 ADA = 1 Vote, which will eventually stagnate governance and centralize it instead of decentralizing it,  as we can extrapolate when you compare this to our current broken fiat government structure which follows the same governance model -> more money = more power. Atala Prism was donated to the Hyperledger Foundation, so does this mean it is ready to be used? Or is more work needed here? It feels like this entire idea has been abandoned when it could be a key part of what we need for true decentralized governance.

Administrators or research teams when there are no results delivered after years (ie: k=1000, a0, min fixed fee). Dancing around the issues without any action and creating more administrative roles (ie: working groups) without any results does not accomplish anything and feels like a waste. Where is the research? If this cannot be handled internally, then provide the tools to the community so we can do the practical research required. What more is needed, a testnet? This is my thought process here.","Fixing long standing issues with staking and parameters, see point 3) above.","Publishing an actual budget with items broken down so that the community can see the cost estimates (t-shirt sizes, whichever). This is what it means to be transparent, and everything else comes off as deflection/ill preparation unfortunately. Leading with a cost estimate of 300-500 Million ADA without any numbers should not happen again :(

We are entering a bull market now, so it is hard to justify the need for 500 Million ADA. Going with a budget of at most the ~334 million we expect to take in as income to the treasury is prudent.

We should be considering our spending actions like a real government would, and save for the hard times instead of asking for all the ADA we'd earn or more. We only have to look at current fiat governments and the broken financial system we have as a result to remind ourselves why we should do better. Cryptocurrency was created to counteract the flaws of fiat and we should not re-create them in our own system.

Saving a surplus would be the wisest move, and having ADA available for governance requests outside of Intersect would also be smart. These will come and we should plan for it. Until I can see numbers to justify Intersect getting management of 300-500 Million ADA, then I can't support this ask.

I can support Intersect getting management of ~200 Million ADA (since Catalyst is included here), leaving ~40 Million ADA available for extra spending items, and the rest to stay in the treasury for saving for the future.

I'd say these are fair numbers that mitigate risk of putting all our ADA in the Intersect basket, and still leaves room for unknowns. If more ADA is needed, then this needs to be justified with real numbers.","No, and not interested or have enough time",Monthly,Both high-level and detail,"Email newsletters, Official website updates, Social media platforms, Community forums","I think there has been a lot learned already for next year, and I hope we can come to a resolution as soon as possible. I do think Intersect has done a good job starting the process, but transparency has to exist outside of Intersect itself. Although Intersect prioritizes its members and working policy through them first, this does not mean that the Cardano community is involved. Large outreach via social media is likely the best way to get community feedback that reflects a large number of people, and as stewards of Cardano's treasury ADA, Intersect should be prioritizing all ADA holders in their decision making process and early on instead of late (which gets a bad reaction).
