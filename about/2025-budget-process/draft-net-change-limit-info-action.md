# Draft - Net Change Limit Info Action

## Title

2025 Net Change Limit

## Abstract

The Cardano Constitution requires the establishment of a Net Change Limit, which defines the maximum amount of lovelace that can be withdrawn from the treasury during an outlined period of time. This governance action serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment across the ecosystem.

This Net Change Limit creates a yearly budget cycle for the Cardano community. The 2025 Net Change Limit will begin at the start of Epoch 532 and continue for 72 epochs, finishing at the conclusion of Epoch 604 in December 2025. The 2025 Net Change Limit will be 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada). This is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period and shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.

The Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing both budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.

### Motivation

Prior to the submission of any budget request, a Net Change Limit must be formally agreed upon. Failure to establish a Net Change Limit shall render any such budget request unconstitutional and, therefore, inapplicable.

The Net Change Limit shall be effective for the period specified in this action. In the event that a mutually agreed Net Change Limit is not established for subsequent periods, the most recently approved Net Change Limit shall remain in force.

The Net Change Limit shall remain in effect until such time as a new Net Change Limit is formally approved in accordance with the applicable governance procedures.

### Rationale

The 2025 Net Change Limit shall begin in Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding in December 2025 at the end of Epoch 604.

The 2025 Net Change Limit shall be set at 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada). This figure was calculated in October 2024, based on the growth metrics available at that time, supplemented by projections for year-end performance.  Our goal with this approach is to incentivize projects to increase utility on the blockchain, ensuring they provide greater value to the broader ecosystem. By fostering innovation, efficiency, and real-world applicability, we aim to drive meaningful advancements that contribute to long-term success and sustainability.

This limit shall be applied in the assessment of budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Cardano Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I.

The Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada) shall automatically apply to each 73-epoch period thereafter unless replaced through formal approval. For example:

* 2025 Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada)
* 2026 Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelace (350M ada)
* Until a new Net Change Limit has been approved&#x20;

A vote in favor of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing for the submission of budget info actions and treasury withdrawal governance actions. The maximum amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury during this specific period shall not exceed the total sum outlined herein.

During the socialization of this Net Change Limit, we received feedback from the community that, since the Net Change Limit controls the total amount that can be withdrawn from the treasury in a specified period, the DRep ratification threshold for the Net Change Limit should be set at 67% of the treasury withdrawal parameter percentage. We neither agree nor disagree; however, we recognize that this Net Change Limit must adhere to the guidance outlined in the Cardano Constitution.

The provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Net Change Limit requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake. Therefore, this Net Change Limit will be considered passed if it is greater than 50%.
