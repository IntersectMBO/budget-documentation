## Proposal Summary

The proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal period will encompass all funding requests made by the Technical Steering Committee and the Open Source Committee. The primary mandate for the allocation of these requested funds is to ensure that they are dedicated specifically to the ongoing development and maintenance of the Cardano blockchain. This includes not only the enhancement of existing features but also the implementation of new advancements that will contribute to the overall stability, security, and efficiency of the Cardano network. By prioritizing these areas, the committees aim to foster innovation and support the continued growth of the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

The proposed Core Budget is ₳ 89,241,317.  This is to be managed by one Treasury withdrawal action using a smart contract to lock funds until the following dates:

| June 2025:     | ₳ 50,000,000 |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| July 2025      | ₳ 12,000,000 |
| August 2025    | ₳ 12,000,000 |
| September 2025 | ₳ 15,241,317 |

## Technical Steering Committee Proposal

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has put forward the following request and supporting breakdown for the 2025 budget process. To assist in visualizing the TSC proposal, the following breakdown has been put forward, which if necessary, is scalable in part to the approved finalized budget.

The budget breakdown shown below has been created following an analysis of the 2024 spend on core Cardano, engineered for expected changes and growth in 2025.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the ADA values shown above represent a potential full year funding, this may be scaled in the final budget request
{% endhint %}

The TSC has requested an additional ₳9m as an emergency/contingency fund but notes this may be handled directly by the budget committee, and has not been included in the outline above

With the exception of the Research element under Roadmap, all funding is expected to come from the Core budget. The funding bucket is a consideration of the Budget Committee and not directly from the TSC.

### Potential Roadmap Projects

The following project cards have been submitted by the community and technical working groups and have been triaged through the Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group.

This process reviews and validates the information provided before being included on the following list for community prioritization.

Final selection will be allocated from the categories above, such as ‘roadmap - core roadmap’ and ‘roadmap - research’.

Full project cards can be viewed[ here](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects).

{% hint style="info" %}
Note I: Project cards are regularly updated and subject to change.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note II: Funding is dependent on prioritization, technical readiness and technical programming. No project should assume funding has been agreed at this stage.
{% endhint %}

A project card is designed to hold relevant and useful information for the community to be able to support prioritisation discussions and recommendations.

When a potential project is submitted for review and inclusion to the backlog, we will ask that this information is provided or an explanation as to why it cannot be.This will enable the community to make informed prioritization decisions.

Project cards outline the overall project goal and benefit, as well the likely deliverable(s) to be funded.

It is expected that throughout the duration of this budget that project prioritization may change and that new initiatives and projects may also need to be considered. To be able to factor this in some allocation has been made above to be prioritized at a later date, categories such as ‘Uncommitted -  Uncommitted core development’.

&#x20;

### Technical Steering

Once the goals and the projects have been prioritized then the Technical Steering Committee will recommend how best to implement them and oversee the technical delivery supported by Intersect delivery assurance teams.

The TSC is a rallying point for members, suppliers, and third parties to coordinate the delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain. As per the committee remit, the TSC will carry out the following:

* Recommending the execution details of the backlog
* Drafting of milestone deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance for the execution recommendation
* Facilitating a tender/award evaluation process for major contracts with members

Further details on the[ Technical Steering Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee) are available via the knowledge base.

**2025 & 2026 Budgets:** Many of the development projects within the TSC budget require an effort of greater than 6 months. Therefore in order to prevent the risk projects having to start and stop, causing increased costs and delays. The TSC is proposing, where required, to allocate 2026 budget to help improve the certainty required deliver on development projects.

| Budget allocation for 2025    | ₳ 78,788,400  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Budget allocation for 2026    | ₳  6,667,917  |
| Final 2025 Budget proposal    | ₳  85,456,317 |

## Open Source Committee Proposal

The proposal has been put together through community input. (Full list of programs and activities included in this proposal can be found here:[ Open Source Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee))

Approval of these proposals will empower the Cardano community to continue its growth, ensure project sustainability, and maintain the high standards of open-source participation within the Cardano ecosystem.

Receiving funding in accordance with this proposal will enable a wide range of essential initiatives to promote and sustain open-source development within the Cardano ecosystem, as outlined in the[ Paid Open Source Model (POSM) Whitepaper](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/intersecting-open-source-and-sustainability-a-paid-open-source-model-for-ecosystems).

The committee strongly believes that this proposal allows for an expansion of the open source efforts achieved in 2024.

### OSC Proposed Initiatives

* Maintainer Retainer Program: Provides consistent financial support to maintainers of up to 50 repositories, ensuring the stability and ongoing development of key projects, these will be nominated by the community and vetted through an[ incubation program](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/project-incubation-lifecycle-framework) and[ contribution ladder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmfCfVhx-Eb_KGWnCebZk6x-tcIsS23G88hZJW5VEuc/edit?usp=sharing).
* 24/7 Incident Response Team: Funds a dedicated 24/7 team to manage security incidents and ensure rapid response capabilities. (Shared request with TSC)
* Project Support Services: Enhances project compliance, design innovation, and community engagement across Cardano open-source initiatives. OSO & OSC would advise and source providers to assist with Marketing, Community Building, Legal, Open Source Strategy & Sustainability, Governance, Product Management, Design, and Training. See[ OSO Service Catalog](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TOC6GYBplVCEahuHAXiZ2A3RY6MsEE9tqvXgNX571Mc/edit?usp=sharing)
* Summer of Code Equivalent: Supports educational stipends and full-time internships for 20 students (all backgrounds), fostering talent development and expanding the pool of skilled contributors.[ Google - Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) Improves OSO DE\&I
* OSO Community Integration, Events, Tooling: Disbursement to OSO to plan, host, and attend hackathon-like events, Developer Advocate events, miscellaneous tooling, Partnerships and Level 1 & 2 Support Services costs.
* Bug Bounty Program: A bug bounty reward program aimed at rewarding community found incidents for projects under the Intersect github, not specifically limited to “Core Cardano”.
* Code for Us Model: Community-driven funding approach for specific development needs, aligning open-source projects with the priorities of Cardano’s user base.
* OSC Members Attending Events: Allowance for OSC sitting Members to attend local/semi-local events.
