## Agenda 1.16.25

* The primary focus was on planning and confirming the schedule and topics for upcoming budget workshops, particularly the initial orientation session on April 10th.
* Discussions aimed to finalize the threshold for proposals to be included in the Budget Info Action, and explore how to measure DREP participation and sentiment for effective decision-making.
* The meeting also touched upon key governance topics for DREP discussion, such as the relationship between the Net Change Limit and budget size, and the handling of unspent funds.

## Decisions/Actions

| Topic                                   | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Action Items                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workshop Schedule & Dates               | The first workshop is set for April 10th, focusing on overarching orientation rather than specific proposals. Subsequent workshops are planned for April 14th, 17th, and 24th. The short lead time for the April 14th session is a concern for topic readiness.                                                                                | N/A                                                                                 |
| Topic Ordering for Workshops            | Proposed order for proposal review: Governance & No Category first, then Marketing & Innovation, followed by Core & Research. This order aims to distribute proposal volume and potentially generate more interest by starting with "harder" or more controversial topics, allowing more time for proposers to make changes before April 26th. | Confirm topic order for the three proposal review workshops.                        |
| Proposed Agenda for April 10th Workshop | The first workshop (April 10th) will have a high-level agenda: budget process overview, schedule, engagement methods, proposal filtering, reconciliation process, and a Gov tool demo. Breakout sessions are planned to discuss topics like Net Change Limit vs. Budget Size, options for unfunded work, and smart contract oversight.         | Finalize agenda details for the April 10th workshop.                                |
| Proposal Filtering & Reconciliation     | Proposal revisions and feedback received asynchronously will feed into Gov tool. This data will be analyzed to track progress and inform the reconciliation workshop, but workshops will not revisit proposals already discussed.                                                                                                              | Analyze Gov tool data to track proposal progress and inform reconciliation.         |
| Budget & Treasury KPIs                  | The inclusion of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the overall budget and treasury was mentioned as a discussion point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Determine if and how KPIs for budget and treasury performance will be incorporated. |
| Threshold for Proposals to Enter BIA    | A key question is establishing the threshold for proposals to move from the workshops into the Budget Info Action (BIA). This includes determining both a percentage of approval and a minimum total stake for participation.                                                                                                                  | Define the threshold (percentage and minimum stake) for proposals to enter the BIA. |
| NCL vs. Budget Size Discussion          | The workshop will aim to differentiate the Net Change Limit (NCL) from the overall budget size, understanding DREP comfort levels with a potentially conservative initial budget.                                                                                                                                                              | Clearly distinguish between NCL and budget size in workshop discussions.            |
| Unspent Funds at Year-End               | A discussion point for DREPs will be deciding the fate of unspent funds at contract delivery end (return to treasury vs. carryover).                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Gather DREP feedback on handling unspent funds at contract delivery end.            |
| Smart Contract Oversight                | The workshop will seek DREP feedback on different options for smart contract oversight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Gather DREP feedback on smart contract oversight options.                           |
| DREP Support Needs                      | The workshop will include an open discussion to understand what support DREPs need to effectively participate in the process, including tuning tools and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                             | Identify and address DREP support needs for the budget process.                     |
