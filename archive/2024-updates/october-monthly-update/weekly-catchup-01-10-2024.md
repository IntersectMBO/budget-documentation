# Weekly Catchup \[01/10/2024]

### Agenda

* Welcome New Observers
* Updates since last meeting
* Update on Draft Budget
* Opens/Parking Lot

### Notes

The committee discussed updates on budget preparation activities, including:

* Documentation of processes and development of presentations for the upcoming Dubai event
* Establishment of a secretary sync meeting for budget coordination
* Presentation at the Intersect Steering Committee
* Review of a budget survey to be released soon
* Release of a Cardano 360 interview about the budget

The current budget draft stands at 156 million ADA without including Project Catalyst numbers. There are still some outstanding items needed, including numbers from Project Catalyst and IOG Research.

Discussion points included:

* The need for alignment between different committees on processes and tooling
* Plans for engaging with DReps (Delegate Representatives) about the budget
* The contracting process, which will involve committee approval, core services review, and final sign-off by the CDF (Cardano Development Fund)
* Plans for independent auditing of work performed under the budget

Concerns were raised about potential inconsistencies if committees develop their own separate processes and tools. The importance of balancing decentralization with consistency was emphasized.

The committee aims to have a more complete budget draft by October 21st for discussion with DReps. Outreach efforts to DReps are beginning, including through influencer channels and creation of explanatory videos and articles about budget processes.
