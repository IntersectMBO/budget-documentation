# Stage 4: Voting and Decision-Making

#### Voting and Decision-Making

In the Cardano budget process, the voting and decision-making steps involve DReps and the Constitutional Committee (CC) and are structured as follows:

1. **Proposal Review and Socialization**: Budget proposals are first socialized, with DReps and CC members providing feedback to refine and align them with community priorities.
2. **Final Voting**: DReps, along with the CC, review the finalized proposals and vote on approval or rejection. A majority vote typically determines the outcome.
3. **Post-Approval Monitoring**: Approved budgets undergo regular quarterly reviews, allowing DReps and the CC to ensure funds are used as intended. This transparency maintains community trust and adherence to the agreed budget.

This system empowers DReps to represent community interests in a structured, accountable manner.
