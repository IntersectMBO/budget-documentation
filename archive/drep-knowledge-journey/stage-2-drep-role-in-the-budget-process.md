#### DRep Role in the budget process

In the Cardano budget process, DReps (Delegated Representatives) play a crucial role in budget approval and oversight. Their responsibilities include:

1. **Reviewing Budget Proposals**: DReps examine proposed budgets, ensuring alignment with Cardano’s strategic goals and community priorities.
2. **Providing Feedback**: They engage in feedback cycles with the Budget Committee to refine proposals, particularly during socialization stages.
3. **Voting on Final Approval**: DReps participate in voting to approve or reject budgets and other financial actions.
4. **Monitoring Quarterly Reports**: DReps review quarterly financial reports to maintain accountability and transparency for approved spending.

This process ensures that DReps represent community interests and uphold the transparency of Cardano’s financial planning.
