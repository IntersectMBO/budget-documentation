## Proposal Summary

The proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal period will encompass all funding requests made by the Technical Steering Committee and the Open Source Committee. The primary mandate for the allocation of these requested funds is to ensure that they are dedicated specifically to the ongoing development and maintenance of the Cardano blockchain. This includes not only the enhancement of existing features but also the implementation of new advancements that will contribute to the overall stability, security, and efficiency of the Cardano network. By prioritizing these areas, the committees aim to foster innovation and support the continued growth of the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

The proposed Core Budget is ₳ 89,241,317.  This is to be managed by one Treasury withdrawal action using a smart contract to lock funds until the following dates:

| June 2025:     | ₳ 50,000,000 |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| July 2025      | ₳ 12,000,000 |
| August 2025    | ₳ 12,000,000 |
| September 2025 | ₳ 15,241,317 |

## Technical Steering Committee Proposal

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has put forward the following request and supporting breakdown for the 2025 budget process. To assist in visualizing the TSC proposal, the following breakdown has been put forward, which if necessary, is scalable in part to the approved finalized budget.

The budget breakdown shown below has been created following an analysis of the 2024 spend on core Cardano, engineered for expected changes and growth in 2025.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the ADA values shown above represent a potential full year funding, this may be scaled in the final budget request
{% endhint %}

The TSC has requested an additional ₳9m as an emergency/contingency fund but notes this may be handled directly by the budget committee, and has not been included in the outline above

With the exception of the Research element under Roadmap, all funding is expected to come from the Core budget. The funding bucket is a consideration of the Budget Committee and not directly from the TSC.

### Potential Roadmap Projects

The following project cards have been submitted by the community and technical working groups and have been triaged through the Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group.

This process reviews and validates the information provided before being included on the following list for community prioritization.

Final selection will be allocated from the categories above, such as ‘roadmap - core roadmap’ and ‘roadmap - research’.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note I: Project cards are regularly updated and subject to change.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note II: Funding is dependent on prioritization, technical readiness and technical programming. No project should assume funding has been agreed at this stage.
{% endhint %}

A project card is designed to hold relevant and useful information for the community to be able to support prioritisation discussions and recommendations.

When a potential project is submitted for review and inclusion to the backlog, we will ask that this information is provided or an explanation as to why it cannot be.This will enable the community to make informed prioritization decisions.

Project cards outline the overall project goal and benefit, as well the likely deliverable(s) to be funded.

It is expected that throughout the duration of this budget that project prioritization may change and that new initiatives and projects may also need to be considered. To be able to factor this in some allocation has been made above to be prioritized at a later date, categories such as ‘Uncommitted -  Uncommitted core development’.

&#x20;

### Technical Steering

Once the goals and the projects have been prioritized then the Technical Steering Committee will recommend how best to implement them and oversee the technical delivery supported by Intersect delivery assurance teams.

The TSC is a rallying point for members, suppliers, and third parties to coordinate the delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain. As per the committee remit, the TSC will carry out the following:

* Recommending the execution details of the backlog
* Drafting of milestone deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance for the execution recommendation
* Facilitating a tender/award evaluation process for major contracts with members

Further details on the[ Technical Steering Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee) are available via the knowledge base.

**2025 & 2026 Budgets:** Many of the development projects within the TSC budget require an effort of greater than 6 months. Therefore in order to prevent the risk projects having to start and stop, causing increased costs and delays. The TSC is proposing, where required, to allocate 2026 budget to help improve the certainty required deliver on development projects.

| Budget allocation for 2025    | ₳ 78,788,400  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Budget allocation for 2026    | ₳  6,667,917  |
| Final 2025 Budget proposal    | ₳  85,456,317 |

## Open Source Committee Proposal

The proposal has been put together through community input. (Full list of programs and activities included in this proposal can be found here:[ Open Source Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee))

Approval of these proposals will empower the Cardano community to continue its growth, ensure project sustainability, and maintain the high standards of open-source participation within the Cardano ecosystem.

Receiving funding in accordance with this proposal will enable a wide range of essential initiatives to promote and sustain open-source development within the Cardano ecosystem, as outlined in the[ Paid Open Source Model (POSM) Whitepaper](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/intersecting-open-source-and-sustainability-a-paid-open-source-model-for-ecosystems).

The committee strongly believes that this proposal allows for an expansion of the open source efforts achieved in 2024.

### OSC Proposed Initiatives

* Maintainer Retainer Program: Provides consistent financial support to maintainers of up to 50 repositories, ensuring the stability and ongoing development of key projects, these will be nominated by the community and vetted through an[ incubation program](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/project-incubation-lifecycle-framework) and[ contribution ladder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmfCfVhx-Eb_KGWnCebZk6x-tcIsS23G88hZJW5VEuc/edit?usp=sharing).

This may include responses to security events and emerging CIPs such as CIP-69 in 2024.<br>A proportion of the development budget has been deliverately left unalloacted in order to enable community members to come forward with additional proposals or to take part in further rounds of prioritisations as outlined above.</td><td>This budget is dedicated to projects that develop Core Cardano, in line with at least one of the Product Committees Goals:<br>1. Attracting more dApps &#x26; Users<br>2. Making Carano easier to use<br>3. Enabling Decentralised Governaance<br>4. Maintaining Cardano's current qualities</td><td>₳18,566,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midgard Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup [Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Midgard is a layer 2 optimistic rollup for Cardano. It has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions onchain but in a more compact form<br><br>Effort: 1 Year Project to complete with a team of 5-6</td><td>Improving scalability and economic sustainability of Cardano<br><br>This represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent economic security. Instead it maximally inherits the security of Cardano.</td><td>$1,573,000</td></tr><tr><td>Hydra Development [Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Hydra is a L2 scaling solution, an isomorphic multi-party state channel. This enables a fixed set of people to create an off-chain ledger with custom parameters, execute transactions and smart contracts, and only settle agreed upon states, to L1, incrementally and upon closure.<br>Comment</td><td>Hydra heads allow effectively unlimited scaling, and the reduction/removal of friction points that currently restrict adoption, like transaction fees, settlement times etc. Hydra heads benefit from the properties of the Cardano ledger, while allowing customization to application specific requirements.</td><td>$2,288,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ouroboros Leios<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Whereas in a classical blockchain the block bodies directly contain transactions, in Leios the block bodies can also contain references to Endorser Blocks which themselves contain references to so-called Input Blocks containing the actual transactions. Those references are certified through a voting mechanism that guarantees a majority of validators agree on the content of Endorser Blocks.</td><td>Increase transaction throughput on Cardano mainnet by orders of magnitude.</td><td>$2,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ouroboros Peras<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Peras modifies the chain-selection rule to include the “boosting” of the dominant chain's blocks by a quorum of votes from periodic randomly-selected voting committees. It modifies the chain-selection rule, the CDDL of the block body, and the creation, transport, and verification of votes and the certificates that witness a quorum of votes. It adds several new protocol parameters.</td><td>Peras reduces settlement time by orders of magnitude without weakening the existing security guarantees. It is compatible with Leios and Genesis, and does not significantly impact node resources.</td><td>$1,430,000</td></tr><tr><td>Revised Stakepool Incentive Scheme<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Several proposals have been made to adjust the current stake pool incentives scheme. A particular concern is that of providing smoother incentives for smaller pools. This project will investigate this important issue, considering the merits of existing proposals, identifying possible improvements to the current scheme with costs/benefits, and outlining a development plan if successful.</td><td>The community will benefit from greater diversity in the stake pool offering, with healthier small pools. Stake pools will benefit from fairer treatment.</td><td>$280,000</td></tr><tr><td>Nested Transactions<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>We propose implementing Nested Transactions, a change to the current ledger design to support a specific kind of transaction batching. This design supports swap intents, by allowing individual transactions in a batch to be unbalanced, but the full batch itself must be balanced. We interpret Babel fees as swap intent. We include several related ledger changes for the purpose of demonstrating the extensibility of this framework to support additional kinds of intents, inclusion of which in the production implementation is optional.</td><td>If implemented, this feature will (1) bring in Ada-less users, (2) make multi-user, multi-UTxO asset swaps cheaper, faster, and with less contention (3) be a step towards supporting arbitrary intents</td><td>$715,000</td></tr><tr><td>Further Core Cardano Devlopment Projects as proposed and reviewed by the community</td><td>Further Core Development work from proposals submitted by the community: <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/Yzy77cQuAEYNjeNy3YrN/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects">Core Backlog proposals can be found here.</a></td><td></td><td>$4,250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Core Development</td><td><br>Contract Type: Typically these will be a a series of fixed payment milestone contracts with set delivereables and payment on sign off of completion<br><br>Community proposed development items that do not directly align with one of the Product Committee Priority Areas. These will be identified and managed in the same manner at the Roadmap Developmenet proposals but enables projects demonstrate community need or benefit that relate to core development to have a route for funding.<br><br>Link to the backlog of <a href="https://technicalsteeringcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects">Core Backlog proposals can be found here.</a></td><td>This budget is dedicated to projects that develop Core Cardano that while not aligning directly under a product committee goal will deliver clear value to the Cardano community.</td><td>₳6,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Research</td><td>Contract Type: Fixed-price contract. Cost associated with the work fulfilled as opposed to hours worked.<br><br>Project Maturity Level: Typically these projects are at SRL Level 5 or Below<br><br>Some Roadmap development work relates to proposals with low levels of maturity that require further research before development and will therefore come from the Research &#x26; Innovation budget.<br>These proposals sit at Software Readiness Level 4 or Less.<br><br>Process:<br>- Project Submission: Anyone within the community can submit a new proposal or initiative related to core development.
