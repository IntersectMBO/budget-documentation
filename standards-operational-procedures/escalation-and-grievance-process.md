# Escalation and Grievance Process

## Purpose

This document outlines the process for escalating issues and filing grievances related to the Cardano Budget Committee's activities, decisions, and conduct. It aims to provide a clear, fair, and structured approach to addressing concerns that cannot be resolved through normal committee processes.

## Scope

This process applies to:

* Committee members
* Working group members
* Cardano community members
* Other stakeholders interacting with the Budget Committee

## Types of Issues

Issues that may be escalated or filed as grievances include, but are not limited to:

* Violations of the Code of Conduct
* Disputes over committee decisions
* Concerns about process fairness or transparency
* Conflicts of interest
* Misuse of committee resources

## Escalation Levels

* Level 1: Within the Committee
*
  * Raise the issue with the Committee Chair
  * The Chair will attempt to resolve the issue within the committee
* Level 2: Executive Steering Committee
*
  * If unresolved at Level 1, or if the issue involves the Chair, escalate to the Executive Steering Committee
  * The Executive Steering Committee will review the issue and attempt to mediate
* Level 3: Board of Directors
*
  * For serious issues or those unresolved at Level 2, escalate to the Intersect Board of Directors
  * The Board's decision will be final and binding

## Grievance Filing&#x20;

### Process

* Submit a written grievance to the Committee Secretary, including:
*
  * Nature of the grievance
  * Relevant dates and facts
  * Attempts made to resolve the issue

### Desired outcome

* The Secretary will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days
* The Secretary will forward the grievance to the appropriate level for review

## Timeline

* Level 1: Resolution attempt within 7 days
* Level 2: Review and mediation attempt within 14 days
* Level 3: Board review and decision within 30 days

## Confidentiality

All parties involved in the escalation and grievance process shall maintain confidentiality to protect the integrity of the process and the privacy of individuals involved.

## Non-Retaliation Policy

Intersect prohibits retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process in good faith.

## Documentation

The Committee Secretary shall maintain confidential records of all escalations and grievances, including resolutions and outcomes.

## Reporting

A summary of escalations and grievances (with personally identifiable information removed) will be included in the committee's annual report to ensure transparency and identify areas for process improvement.

## Special Circumstances

* If a grievance involves multiple committee members or systemic issues, it may be escalated directly to Level 2 or 3.
* For urgent matters that pose immediate risk to the integrity of the Cardano ecosystem, expedited processes may be initiated at the discretion of the Executive Steering Committee or Board of Directors.

## Resolution and Follow-up

* Once a resolution is reached, all involved parties will be notified in writing.
* The Committee Secretary will follow up after 30 days to ensure the resolution has been implemented and the issue has not recurred.

## Appeals

* Decisions made at Levels 1 and 2 may be appealed to the next level within 7 days of the decision.
* Board of Directors decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

## Training and Awareness

All committee members will receive training on this escalation and grievance process as part of their onboarding and annual refresher training.

## Review and Amendment

This process will be reviewed annually and may be amended by a super majority vote of the Budget Committee members, subject to approval by the Executive Steering Committee.

By participating in the Cardano Budget Committee or its processes, all parties agree to adhere to this Escalation and Grievance Process.
