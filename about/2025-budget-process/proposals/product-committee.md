## Product Committee Budget Proposal

### Overview

The Product Committee serves as a strategic facilitator for Cardano's development direction, bringing together 7 voting members and over 20 Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from across the ecosystem. Established in August 2024, our mandate focuses on viewing Cardano holistically as a product and coordinating community-driven development priorities.

Our 2025 budget proposal has been developed through extensive community consultation, including weekly focus groups, community-wide calls, open forums, and collaboration with other Intersect committees. This comprehensive engagement process has helped shape a proposal that reflects both the technical needs and community aspirations for Cardano's future.

The proposal focuses on four key areas: ecosystem growth and usage, governance evolution, core infrastructure maintenance, and strategic vision development. Each area has been carefully considered to ensure Cardano's continued advancement while maintaining its fundamental qualities and community-driven nature.
