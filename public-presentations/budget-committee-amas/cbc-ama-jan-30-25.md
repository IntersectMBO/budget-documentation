<summary>Session Summary:</summary>

The latest Cardano Budget Committee AMA session provided updates on the ongoing budget process and upcoming governance actions. Discussions covered the newly launched constitutional ratification process, the timeline for governance approvals, and the forthcoming net change limit info action. The committee outlined plans for releasing detailed budget proposals in the forums for community discussion before they move to an on-chain vote.

Participants asked about budget proposal processes, including how individuals and groups can engage with intersect committees such as the Membership & Community Committee (MCC), Open Source Committee (OSC), and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The session also touched on funding for regional hubs, event sponsorships, and how new proposals can fit into the 2025 budget structure.

Another key discussion point was the formation of the new Marketing and Growth Committee, which will oversee outreach efforts, including events, partnerships, and promotional initiatives. The committee is currently being formed, with elections for public seats scheduled in April. The AMA also addressed questions regarding potential funding for industry-specific adoption efforts, including government and municipal initiatives.

As the budget process moves forward, the committee emphasized the importance of community participation in discussions on the Cardano Forum and upcoming governance actions. Attendees were encouraged to monitor governance proposals using Cardano Explorer tools and Intersectâ€™s governance announcements to stay informed on the latest developments.
