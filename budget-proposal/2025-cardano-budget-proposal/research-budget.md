## Motivation

### Academic research Expected outcomes

The Vision and Impact plan for Cardano is committed to ensuring Cardano is able to meet and exceed the blockchain industry's aspirations. The plan is informed by impact assessments and extensive stakeholder consultations, reflecting on lessons learned over the past five years.

RWG proposes 9 thematic focus areas, each outlining specific R\&D directions that will position Cardano as a global blockchain leader for the next decade and beyond. Within each focus area, we detail the motivation, technical challenges, and benefits for Cardano, demonstrating how each direction aligns with specific blockchain tenets and Product Committee goals. These thematic focus areas provide a roadmap for research and development, ensuring that efforts are not only innovative but also relevant to the Cardano mission. Each thematic focus area is chosen to tackle critical issues, drive technological advancements, and ultimately enhance the platform's capabilities, sustainability, and global impact.

Over the next five years, these directions should be thoroughly explored, leading to their integration as functional components and extensions of the Cardano platform. They serve as strategic pillars that guide advancement and development and concentrate on specific, high-impact challenges and opportunities, ensuring that research efforts are aligned with long-term goals and needs. By defining clear thematic focus areas, resources can be effectively directed toward exploring cutting-edge solutions, fostering innovation, and addressing key technical and societal challenges.

Each R\&D direction or workstream within the 2025 work plan is designed with a clear motivation, identifying the technical challenges it aims to overcome and the benefits it will bring to Cardano. The objectives of each work plan are clearly defined, focusing on creating specific deliverables such as enhanced protocols, improved tokenomics, or new functionalities for DApp developers. The tasks and deliverables are structured to meet minimal requirements essential for successful implementation, with considerations for staffing, cost, references, and timelines. This structured approach allows for efficient resource allocation and progress tracking, ensuring that each workstream contributes effectively to Cardano's long-term vision of a robust, secure, and scalable blockchain platform.

Given the early-stage nature of research and the inherent uncertainties that come with pioneering new developments, it is essential to remain adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances. To this end, a 'portfolio approach' to the management and allocation of research resources and the prioritization of specific research workstreams is requested. This ensures funds are optimally allocated across thematic focus areas and workstreams and that resources are directed where they can have the most significant impact.

### Product research expected outcomes

For year 1, 2025, the research conducted in this sub-bucket aims to provide insights into the direction and refinement of the proposed goals for 2025 and support other committees with information on user needs. In addition to this short-term need, the insights from this first year will directly inform the Cardano strategy in the short term (2025 and 2026) and help create a longer-term vision. The outcome of this research will also lead to clear problem statements which will be documented as Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs).

### Vision creation expected outcomes

For year 1, the work conducted in this sub-bucket aims to provide a first-tested process for the Cardano community to brainstorm, set, track, and evolve its own vision and roadmap. The outcome of that process is the first version of a 5-year Cardano vision and a 2026 roadmap based on that.

Product committee overhead expected outcomes

This sub-bucket aims to cover any overhead the product committee itself might have in facilitating and managing the three buckets above as well as delivering against its core objectives (support vision and roadmap creation as well as keeping track of its progress)

### Academic Research sub-bucket

#### Overview

The Academic research bucket aims to fund all research activities that can provide long-term insights into the Cardano ecosystem. This will be guided by a five-year Strategic Research Agenda which adheres to an "evidence-based engineering" methodology focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The methodology from initial design through to engineering implementation ensures a funnel of high-quality, efficient, and proven products and features that deliver long-term fundamental value to the Cardano ecosystem.

To continue to position itself as a leading third-generation blockchain, Cardano requires a robust five-year research agenda that focuses on sustainability, scalability, and interoperability. This vision builds on Cardano's track record of 100% uptime, ensuring continuous improvement and maintaining its position at the forefront of blockchain technology. To achieve this, advances in certain focus areas are required including consensus algorithms, such as Ouroboros Omega, zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-resistant cryptography, and enhanced smart contract functionality. The goal is to reinforce Cardano’s positioning and leadership that addresses global and societal challenges while driving innovation and maintaining high security and efficiency standards.

The impact of this planned approach is severalfold; a targeted and ever-growing presence in a global research community, and direct outputs in the form of papers, technical recommendations, and validated prototypes. Commercializing deep technologies such as Web3 cannot just be demand-led. Scientific and technical excellence, a prerequisite in Cardano’s case, can take years to achieve by which time opportunities can be lost. Strategic investments in research areas with high potential for future innovation not only establish a strong foundation for growth but also create a competitive advantage through accelerating time to market. This enables opportunities to be seized in a timely manner and enables the resulting economic, societal, and environmental impact to be realized.

#### Broad acceptance criteria

Each year RWG's goal is to generate a robust pipeline of at least 20 research opportunities at SRL2, underpinned by comprehensive research papers and technical reports. From this funnel, we aim to validate and prioritize 6 key innovation opportunities for implementation that have been thoroughly validated through a multidisciplinary team across engineering, product development, customer engagement as well as research.

&#x20;

This funnel approach is designed to lay a strong foundation for Cardano, ensuring a continuous pipeline of high-impact and strategic opportunities with global ambitions that address the most significant challenges in the blockchain space. The outputs and deliverables outlined below are focused on reinforcing and advancing Cardano's leadership in the blockchain industry.

&#x20;

Research

Papers published within this context can vary significantly in terms of length, complexity, and strategic importance, with the average paper taking at least two years to publish. This timeline is influenced by the peer review process, which can extend over several months and often requires multiple submission cycles, reflecting the high standards of academic publishing.

The landscape of research conferences is also evolving, becoming increasingly competitive, particularly in key areas relevant to blockchain and cryptography. This heightened competition underscores the need for quality and excellence in research outputs. Given this variability, we are committed to maintaining a consistent output of at least 20 research papers and technical reports per year across the research workstream portfolio, ensuring that we continue to contribute meaningfully to both the global research community and more specifically the Cardano ecosystem.

In addition to producing high-quality research, RWG recognizes the importance of visibility and impact within the academic and broader technology communities. Citations are a key measure of a paper's influence, and we are actively working to increase the reach and recognition of our research. To support this, we are enhancing our marketing efforts, ensuring that our work is not only published but also disseminated effectively across the relevant channels. By doing so, we aim to foster greater engagement with our research, amplifying its impact and solidifying Cardano's position as a leader in blockchain innovation.

&#x20;

Innovation

The innovation deliverables include the creation and dissemination of 6 prototypes, technical reports, and Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs) as a result of these workstreams. Please note workstreams starting in the second half of the year will be delivered the following year.

These technical reports will provide in-depth analyses and documentation of each emerging technology and supporting methodologies that are critical to the continued advancement of the solution by product teams within the Cardano ecosystem. Each report will serve as a foundation for future development and inform the community and stakeholders of the requirement for implementation. The prototypes developed alongside these reports will demonstrate the practical application of these innovations, providing tangible examples of how theoretical advancements can be translated into real-world solutions.

In addition to the technical reports and prototypes, Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs) are a key component of our innovation strategy. CIPs are vital for fostering collaboration and transparency within the Cardano community, allowing for community-driven enhancements to the platform. By submitting well-researched and strategically important CIPs, we aim to address specific needs and challenges within the ecosystem, ensuring that Cardano remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

#### Requested Budget

We propose a budget of $13.42M. The total budget proposed is to finance all supplier activities across both academic research and innovation with a total of 56.1 FTEs. This equates to an average of circa $239k per FTE (or $1,030 per day based on 232 working days per year) including all costs as outlined below. This includes a shared services allocation of 15% (below industry standards of 20-25%) as well as all other costs including equipment, software licenses, server costs, any sub-contracting that may be required (for example to academic partners or third-party engineers), travel costs, events and program and portfolio management.

Research Streams\
\
The research departmental budget is circa $5.895M for a total of 27.5 FTEs in terms of labor resources. This is approximately $295k per workstream per year, at an average of circa 1.3 FTE, where it takes on average 2 years or more to publish a research paper, and includes:

* an average of $180k per FTE
* all sub-contracting and strategic partnerships with universities
* $175k team travel budget to attend conferences
* 15% shared services allocation

Each of the research workstreams requires a mix of academic experience that can include distributed systems, consensus, protocol design and security, applied cryptography, game theory, and formal specifications/verification. The resources allocated to each workstream can vary from 2-6 team members, and typically include the following roles:

1. Chief Scientist - oversees research strategy, drives innovation, and academic excellence
2. Professors - world-renowned experts in their field
3. Senior Research Fellow - leads advanced research projects, mentors researchers, and publishes findings.
4. Research Fellow - conducts specialized research, collaborates on projects, and contributes to publications.
5. Researcher (Associates and PhDs) -  pursues doctoral research, assists in studies, and develops expertise.
6. Engineers - Research, Formal Method or Software - develops and implements technical solutions, supports research, and ensures software quality. At the start of a research workstream the FTE scope can be very wide due to the high level of uncertainty, and as the workstream develops this is then narrowed as investigative directions are realized.

&#x20;

Innovation Streams\
\
The innovation departmental budget is $7,525,000 for a total of 28.6 FTEs in terms of labor resources. This is approximately $1.25M per innovation workstream for 6-12 months of intensive effort and includes:

* an average $200k per FTE
* 2 on-site workshops per year costing $60k that facilitate planning, knowledge sharing, and collaboration sessions
* 15% shared services allocation

Each of the 6 innovation workstreams requires specific dedicated skill sets which might vary depending on development requirements (for example, not all require cryptographic knowledge). The resources allocated to each workstream typically range from 4.6 - 6 FTEs and include the following roles:

(a) Product manager / Developer relationship - Develops product discovery, market fit, builds the use cases, and identifies supporting customers

(b) Technical Architect - define and provide inputs on the prototype/target environment

(c) Prototyping engineer (software) - Prototyping, Modeling and Simulation Engineer(s)

(d) Applied Cryptographer - define and provide inputs on the cryptographic primitives implementation and benchmark

(e) Researcher liaison - author and support the team on additional research and paper publications

(f) Formal methods engineer - define formal models, specifications, and executable models to be used in performance testing.

Geographic diversity can only be assessed truthfully when taking the Internet topology (underlying architecture such as submarine cables, etc) into account.<br><br>The main open questions are therefore: (a) how can we measure the geographic diversity of a decentralized system that is built on the Internet (b) how can we design incentives such that the stakeholders of the system gravitate towards a stable equilibrium where the locations of the nodes are as diverse as possible</td><td>Location information is becoming increasingly important: decentralization, geopolitics, legal, access control, etc. DApps &#x26; user growth.</td><td>₳278,833</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Ouroboros Peras (Vision)</td><td>The Cardano ledger is currently maintained by Ouroboros Praos, a longest-chain type of proof-of-stake consensus protocol. These protocols exhibit several desirable robustness features including tolerance to fluctuating participation and self-healing from temporary periods of adversarial dominance.<br><br>However, a well-understood downside of longest-chain consensus is that it only provides gradual settlement, requiring a sufficient number of blocks to appear on top of a transaction of interest to consider it settled. This property of the mainchain might impede adoption and complicate deployment of various layer-2 functionalities envisioned for the Cardano ecosystem.</td><td>The immediate effect would be better user experience for parties transacting on chain. Moreover, such settlement times would also be an enabler for various layer-2 functionalities and for bridging to other blockchains further increasing growth and interoperability.</td><td>₳250,950</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Ouroboros Leios</td><td>The current Ouroboros design (Praos) is almost at its limits with respect to throughput, as increasing the block production rate or block size further may negatively affect the protocol’s security. Moreover, Praos only partially takes advantage of the available resources in the network (network bandwidth / cpu / memory); on expectation one block of size ~100 KB is sent every 20 seconds. On the other hand, increasing throughput to meet demand is key to serving Cardano’s vision of being part of the infrastructure of an ecosystem of blockchains / sidechains.<br><br>To this end, Leios aims to be the first protocol in the Ouroboros family where throughput is proportional to the resources available to individual nodes. Moreover, the goal is for throughput to scale vertically, i.e, the system’s performance should scale as more resources are provided to the machines running the system–doubling the resources of all machines in the system should result in approximately double the throughput.</td><td>This will increase throughput in order to develop the ecosystem (partnerchains, etc).</td><td>₳460,075</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Fair transaction processing</td><td>Ouroboros, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum L1 consensus protocols, does not offer any guarrantees regarding "fairness" in terms of transaction processing. In particular this means that there are no guarrantees against front running or preferential ordering in the way transactions are organized in the ledger. In the Ethereum ecosystem this has been described as both a problem and opportunity in the context of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Nevertheless, the resulting modifications such as proposer builder separation have also negative effects such as increased centralization of the L1 operation. In this thread, we develop techniques for ensuring fairness of transaction processing as a default feature of the underlying blockchain protocol. This will require modifications in the L1 as well as novel cryptographic techniques to be developed, analyzed and implemented.</td><td>If this research result is achieved and realized it can be a unique selling point for Cardano, as there are no public blockchains at the moment offering fair transaction processing.</td><td>₳446,133</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Multi-resource consensus - Minotaur</td><td>Multi-resource consensus refers to permissionless consensus where the right to produce a block is derived from proving possession of different resources, e.g., a mixture of proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), as opposed to just standard PoW or PoS. Relying on more than one single resource can give stronger security guarantees than relying just on a single resource. For example, consensus solely based on PoW cannot tolerate a dishonest majority of computing resources, while basing it on PoW and PoS can tolerate it (by compensating with a lower corruption level on the PoS side).<br><br>Multi-resource consensus is particularly useful to secure the bootstrapping of new blockchains as follows. Assume you want to launch a new PoS blockchain to be eventually controlled by its native asset. Initially the asset is illiquid, the stake distribution might be very imbalanced, and not all stakeholders might be ready to actively participate in stake delegation or block production. Initially mixing in different assets to control the sidechain via (restaked) PoS now helps to keep the system stable as the holders of those assets are already up and running, and prepared to support the new sidechain.</td><td>Multi-resource sidechains consensus will make it easy to bootstrap new Cardano sidechains, helping to attract them to the Cardano ecosystem.</td><td>₳209,125</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Proofs of useful work</td><td>The main motivation for this research direction is to employ any significant computational effort performed to solve real-world problems such as, scheduling, protein folding, and others, as a resource for securing an underlying consensus protocol. Via multi-resource consensus, this can benefit the Cardano ecosystem both in terms of increasing security and in terms of providing an on ramp to the ecosystem via computational effort, while simultaneously not incurring any energy wastage as in the case with PoW systems.<br><br>The main mechanism to do this is Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) schemes, which allow securely integrating blockchain protocols with useful computations. While long being discussed, manifestations of this idea have been limited to non-widely useful computations, such as those employed in Primecoin. In 2022, IOG researchers published the first instance of Ofelimos, a provably secure PoUW protocol, focusing on local search algorithms for hard computational problems such as SAT. Future research will investigate extending PoUWs to other domains, such as proving zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) for blockchain state proofs, training large machine learning models and solving large scale hard optimization problems.</td><td>In terms of impact, we expect PoUW-based blockchain to attract high-value industrial businesses into our ecosystem, as they are in need of regularly solving optimization problems cheaply, e.g., transportation companies.</td><td>₳892,267</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Congestion control</td><td>Current congestion control solutions typically employ transaction fees, primarily based on two designs: flat fees (e.g. on Cardano) or dynamic fees set through a per block auction (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum). In either design, all associated costs, such as storage, bandwidth or computation are lumped together into one final price that the transaction issuer needs to pay. In addition, transactions have no way to declare their urgency and must either accept the current level of fees for immediate service or pay less, anticipating lower congestion in the future.<br><br>Because dynamic fees increase with demand that cannot be met due to limited blockchain scaling, they are generally unpredictable and harder to budget for. Flat fees can offer a more predictable experience, but only during periods of low to moderate demand. Otherwise, they are susceptible to cheap DoS attacks, cannot provide the immediate service required for DeFi and cannot differentiate between high and low value traffic.</td><td>A successful design would enable increased ecosystem growth due to the ease of participation for a variety of applications, e.g., low urgency, business, DeFI.</td><td>₳446,133</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Tokenomics design</td><td>We will investigate first principles in tokenomics to inform optimal long-term macroeconomic token policies for the Cardano ecosystem. The evolution of token prices over time is crucial in all blockchains in order to (i) maintain system security and (ii) incentivize larger adoption by the users.</td><td>This research will enable; economic, adoption and ecosystem growth, more diverse and broader tokenomics capabilities and improved governance.</td><td>₳334,600</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Rewards sharing and transaction fees</td><td>An important component in blockchain systems in order to achieve a successful level of decentralized operation is the proper incentivization of participating users. Towards this goal, the main toolkit for incentivizing desirable behavioral patterns is the design of appropriate reward schemes, e.g., as used for distributing revenues from block production and transaction fees.<br><br>Reward schemes within blockchains introduce additional challenges related to anonymity, player asymmetries (i.e., SPO vs delegators of a pool), and the desire for decentralized solutions. But Sybil attacks and decentralization aspects are often ignored in the more traditional models of revenue distribution and coalition formation. Although we have seen the emergence of more appropriate reward schemes in the last few years, there is undoubtedly ample room for improvement and for coming up with better solutions that would achieve even more satisfactory performance.</td><td>The outcome of this research is aimed at improving, in the long term, the current reward sharing scheme of Cardano, which is an important component of the entire protocol. This in turn can affect user experience and satisfaction. Furthermore, this research has the potential to create impact for other types of payment schemes that are used within Cardano, such as the Voltaire dRep rewards or the rewards issued for reviewers and delegates under project Catalyst.</td><td>₳111,533</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Decentralized identity and reputation management</td><td>A global identity system is expected to allow everybody access to a reliable identity that can be used seamlessly through different digital platforms, and gives full control of their identity(ies) to end users, including letting them choose what information is made accessible by third parties.<br><br>Foundations: The notion of global identity we derive must be independent of concrete instantiations. However, it is also desirable to, at this point, think of generic ways to build it. In this regard, leveraging abstractions of related lower-level building blocks is desirable. For instance, a construction of a global identity notion will (most likely) require roots of trust and credentials. For the former, we will need to rely on formal notions of generalized PKIs, likely including DID-based PKIs. Similarly, for the latter, we will need to rely on formal notions of generalized credential systems, including VCs and ACs. Therefore, as a second derivative of defining a notion for global identity, we will be looking into formally defining generic and formal abstractions of these components. It can be expected that, by formally defining these components, we identify tradeoffs in the different ways to build them: for instance, an X509-based PKI may not achieve certain properties that a DID-based achieves, or vice versa. Thus, this study may serve to establish guidelines for building a global identity system, depending on the desired properties.<br><br>Concrete Instantiations: With a well-defined notion of a global identity, including a first general design built on top of ideal (and also general) building blocks, we can start looking at possible constructions. While during the definition of the global identity notion and its building blocks we will likely come up with generic constructions, they will likely not be the most efficient ones, and fine tuning will be needed for them to achieve practicality. The focus of this work package will be to come up with concrete instantiations that do achieve practicality – both in terms of computational and communication costs, as well as the required engineering effort to bring them to reality.<br><br>Applications: The questions we will try to answer in this work package are devoted to studying the concrete needs that these applications may have from a global identity system, and the mutual relationship between the global identity system, and the applications themselves – for instance, as sources of further identity information. Concretely: “What properties from the global identity system are needed by the chosen applications?”, “How can the global identity system extract identity information from these applications?” Concretely, the latter may have an interesting variant, which looks into “How can identity information in system A be ‘moved’ to system B?” (where system A and system B may, for instance, be different blockchains).<br><br>Integration: For a global identity system to be really global, it needs to be integrated within the larger identity space. This has two variants: (1) integrating the derived notion of global identity into the existing identity space; and (2) integrating the constructions achieved in concrete instantiations into the applications designed.</td><td>Establishing the foundations of (decentralized) identity systems, and associated frameworks, such as PKIs. This domain has lacked formalization. This research will equip Cardano's broader ecosystem with the (theoretical, and PoC-level code) tooling to augment everything we do with identity-related information, in a privacy-preserving manner.</td><td>₳376,460</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Next-level governance protocols</td><td>A central theme in Cardano’s vision is the deployment of systems that help the management and long-term sustainability of its blockchain ecosystem, clarifying how its core and external contributors should collaborate. Governance protocols, and in particular voting protocols, can support a variety of decision-making procedures (representative, stake based, or delegative/liquid amongst others) with participation from most of the blockchain stakeholders and thus, are a key enabler of this vision. Existing e-voting protocols, however, are typically designed for non-blockchain settings, and often assume centralized services for tallying and/or recording of the votes. Recent proposals aim to make use of off-the-shelf protocols and additionally utilize a ledger to decentralize some aspects of the voting. Implementing such solutions and integrating them with Cardano may come with an unacceptably high main chain footprint, which in turn makes their running costs too high for blockchain governance.<br></td><td>A desirable impact would be the use of one or more of these protocols for running elections/governance efforts more effectively within the Cardano ecosystem (eg. Catalyst/Cardano Foundation elections).</td><td>₳306,717</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Governance incentives</td><td>Governance incentives refer to the alignment of the goals of participants of a blockchain ecosystem. While sufficient robustness has been achieved, it is difficult to balance swift and effective decision making with the fundamental blockchain principles of decentralization, security, transparency, and fairness. This is particularly challenging now that the set of blockchain participants has been expanded and cannot be adequately captured just by the number of tokens owned by each wallet.</td><td>The outcome of this research is aimed at improving in the long term the current procedures that are in place for project Catalyst and at the same time the voting procedures for the governance actions during the Voltaire era. Both Voltaire and Catalyst are significant components for the entire Cardano community, and therefore it is of utmost importance to have well thought out election procedures that can reduce the risks and dangers arising from malicious users.</td><td>₳223,067</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Hydra Tail</td><td>The Hydra suite of protocols is a key component of Cardano’s layer-2 scarling solutions. Hydra Tail follows the states-channel Hydra Head protocol. Tail is a zk-rollup solution that processes a batch of transactions off-chain and reduces on-chain computation and storage needs by providing a summary (roll-up) of the transactions performed. Clients can safely move funds and smart contracts back and forth between the blockchain and the off-chain protocol. Hydra Tail, like Hydra Head, will provide safeguards against censorship of clients and reduce trust assumptions on servers through a (sound) ZK proof system.<br><br>We expect the Hydra Tail state machine to take a form as follows. The contract starts at the initial state. And after appropriate checks it transitions to the open state where clients can commit funds to L2; the server can collect committed funds, and in regular intervals updates snapshots to L1. In case of a recall (e.g., because a transaction gets censored by the server) a client can advance the state machine to the failed state. In this state, all clients have the opportunity to reclaim/recall their committed funds. Once a sufficiently long period of time passes (or the server decides to “retire”), the state machine transitions to the closed state. A special registered transaction (regTx) operation allows users to circumvent censorship.</td><td>By increasing the number of transactions processed per second at reduced fees, zk-rollup forms a core technology to support Cardano's scalability needs.</td><td>₳306,717</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Inter-Head</td><td>Layer-2 refers to a family of blockchain protocols that aim to improve the blockchain's scalability. These protocols let parties lock their funds on-chain into a channel structure, which facilitates interactions between participating parties that can transact with another off-chain a potentially arbitrary amount of times and only result in a footprint of at most a constant number of on-chain transactions. Solutions range from simple two-party payment channels to isomorphic multi-party state channels [1], i.e., the Hydra Protocol. Further work builds up extends it, for instance, creation of multi-party state channel networks [2], i.e., the Interhead Protocol. However, a common drawback of these works - with the exception of a few cases - is a lack of formal security treatment, where formalization in the Universal Composability (UC) Framework [3] is considered the state of the art in the field.</td><td>This project is to determine the security of Hydra and Interhead while composing with other protocols to construct more complex applications. Layer-2 is one of the best approaches to increase the number of transactions. It can be used as the foundation for creating applications/protocols, acting as a middle ware to the consensus layer. In order to safely rely on such a design to safely compose with other applications, it is paramount to investigate the universal composability of Hydra and Interhead.</td><td>₳167,300</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Optimization tools</td><td>The Hydra Suite of protocols is a family of protocols for layer-2, and therefore it shares common characteristics of other existing layer-2 protocols, such as payment channels, state and virtual channels. For a smooth operation over the Hydra based network, optimized protocols are required to address issues like funds rebalancing, message routing and head synchronization. For example, the locking of collateral funds can be essential to enable securing transactions. Furthermore, the capacity of such a multiparty, or pair-wise, channel funds the transactions, however the accumulation of asymmetric flows of funds may deplete such capacity, hence no further transactions occur in the channel. While other channel capacity securing a different channel may still be allocated but unused. Other potential limitations exist.</td><td>Similarly, to hydra and interhead which can be used as a foundation for more sophisticated application, therefore its universal composability needs to be thoroughly analyzed. In addition to the design with Hydra and interhead, more specific auxiliary protocols can also be used, hence they need their composability to be proven.<br>The goal of this project is to establish the security of auxiliary protocols with respect to our base layer-2 protocols, Hydra and Interhead.</td><td>₳111,533</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Auditing tools</td><td>Layer-2 solutions such payment channels, state channels, or virtual channels provide increased throughput and settlement speed to layer-1 of a blockchain system by having parties perform off-chain payments (or in general: state transitions), only coming back to the layer-1 chain if the funds must be claimed for a different context. As such they are the prime solution for scaling. In the context of Cardano, the Hydra protocol suite is realizing the full potential of layer 2. Such state channels have, however, a drawback that cannot be ignored: after committing funds on layer-1, all transactions are off-chain and potentially private and discussions emerge about the balance between privacy and accountability in this context. Instead of state channels behaving like black holes with respect to the actual transaction history, it would be beneficial if the Hydra protocol suite is equipped with a new mode that allows for controlled and reliable access to the crucial information about its transaction history by an accredited auditor; a mode that strikes a good balance between privacy, auditability, and accountability.</td><td>Accountability is a topic that has gained a lot of traction in the past couple of years and is actively researched right now. Various privacy-preserving yet auditable systems have been suggested most notably on layer 1 or in the context of CBDCs. This research proposal takes such proposals to a next level as a layer-2 solution. Since layer 2 solutions encompass multi-party computations of arbitrary kind, it will be able to integrate state of the art cryptographic algorithms and equip them with checks that enable audits and accountability. Such solutions will not only be able to have industry partners and financial institutions to endorse scalability solutions of Cardano, but can enable other systems to access the Cardano network and its technology to realize a compliance layer of their own system.</td><td>₳641,317</td></tr><tr><td>Academic research: Light client infrastructure</td><td>This project has the potential for several publishable units spanning a duration of at least three years. The starting position is the lack of light client functionality in the Cardano ecosystem.

The seminal Bitcoin paper let the communities rethink under what assumptions achieving consensus is possible. Roughly, two main paradigms have emerged over the past decade: one paradigm is the so-called Nakamoto-consensus, which, roughly speaking, are protocols where participants are supposed to extend a longest chain, where the resources dictate with what probability a particular party is allowed or elected to extend the chain. Consensus is reached over time, where parties agree on the blocks on the longest chain, except for possibly the most recent couple of blocks.<br><br>The second paradigm is porting prior results on BFT consensus to the blockchain setting, either taking Feldman-Micali style BFT protocols as basis, or PBFT by Liskov as a foundation. A large body of literature has followed both paradigms and brought them into the permissionless and permissioned, most notably the Hotstuff line of work represents the evolution of PBFT, while Algorand represents the evolution of graded-consensus in the blockchain era. It is clear that by no means we have reached the peak in the innovation and development of new paradigms for consensus. This research stream captures several directions in which known consensus approaches can be developed and implemented, and new paradigms can be investigated.</td><td>For the long-term objective, the research can yield new types of consensus algorithms relevant for the future of Cardano backbone itself.</td><td>₳278,833</td></tr><tr><td>Academic innovation</td><td>This group is to fulfil the following projects:<br><br>The Academic innovation sub-bucket aims to fund the validation of the academic research step.<br><br>This is approximately $1.25M per innovation workstream for 6-12 months of intensive effort and includes:<br>- an average $200k per FTE<br>- 2 on-site workshops per year costing $60k that facilitate planning, knowledge sharing, and collaboration sessions<br>- 15% shared services allocation<br></td><td></td><td>₳8,779,169</td></tr><tr><td>Academic innovation: Leios</td><td>Ouroboros Leios is a high-throughput protocol for Cardano.

To achieve this, the workstream adapts the Halo2 proving system, utilizing Pluto-Eris curves and KZG commitments for smaller proofs and faster verification.
