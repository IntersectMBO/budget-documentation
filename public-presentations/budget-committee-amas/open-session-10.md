<summary>Session Summary:</summary>

The latest session of the Cardano Budget Committee AMA featured members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), including Chair Kevin Hammond, along with Matt Davis and Marcus Gufler. The session provided an overview of the TSC’s proposed budget for 2025, highlighting key priorities and answering community questions about technical development within the Cardano ecosystem.

The session began with an introduction to the meeting structure. Kevin Hammond led a presentation on the TSC’s approach to budgeting, emphasizing that the committee is not simply listing fixed projects but instead prioritizing broader areas of work. The focus is on creating an inclusive and open development process where multiple development teams can submit bids and tender for specific projects. This approach aims to distribute Cardano’s technical development efforts more widely across the community.

Kevin explained that the budget process has been informed by several key groups, including the Core Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group and the Product Committee. The TSC has been aligning its goals with these committees to ensure that the proposed development work is consistent with Cardano’s broader roadmap. The Product Committee has held open sessions to gather community input and establish high-level goals, while the Open Source Committee has contributed insights on decentralized development strategies.

The discussion then moved to the methodology behind project prioritization. The TSC emphasized that while some projects are already identified as critical, the process remains flexible. Community members are encouraged to participate by proposing new work items through the ongoing survey and feedback mechanisms. The goal is to align development priorities with community needs while maintaining stability and security for Cardano. Some projects will be large and complex, requiring long-term commitments, while others may be smaller and easier to implement. The TSC aims to balance both types of work within the budget.

To support transparency, the TSC has outlined multiple ways for the community to get involved. Open calls and surveys have been set up to gather feedback, with a deadline for the initial round of input set for early December. However, the process will remain open beyond that date, allowing for continuous participation throughout 2025. Community members are encouraged to review the proposed projects, provide feedback, and suggest additional areas of focus.

A key part of the discussion focused on the proposal submission process. The TSC clarified that while they are defining broad work areas, they are not pre-selecting specific vendors or development teams. Instead, there will be an open tendering process where developers and companies can bid on projects. This ensures that the best-qualified teams are selected for each task while maintaining fairness and decentralization in Cardano’s development efforts.

Kevin also discussed the importance of maintaining core Cardano infrastructure. While innovation and new projects are important, the stability and security of the blockchain must remain a top priority. This means allocating resources to ongoing maintenance, addressing critical technical challenges, and ensuring that Cardano’s core systems remain robust and competitive. Some of the areas identified for development include improvements to transaction throughput, finality mechanisms, pricing models, and layer-two scaling solutions.

Another major topic was the concept of an **uncommitted budget** within the TSC’s allocation. The committee proposed that approximately 30% of the budget should remain unallocated to account for unexpected challenges and emerging priorities throughout the year. This flexibility allows the TSC to respond to unforeseen technical issues or new opportunities without disrupting ongoing projects. The community was invited to provide feedback on this approach to ensure that it aligns with governance expectations.

During the Q\&A session, several key topics were addressed. Georgio raised a question about how the bottom-up and top-down budgeting processes will be reconciled. Kevin explained that the focus will be on prioritizing work items first, with funding decisions made accordingly. If the proposed work exceeds available funding, lower-priority items will be deferred or adjusted.

Juan Sierra brought up the importance of preparing for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and the potential impact of Bitcoin OS on Cardano’s infrastructure. Kevin acknowledged that these are significant considerations and noted that the research team has been exploring quantum resistance strategies. Bitcoin OS is also a topic of discussion within the TSC, and its implications will be assessed as development progresses.

The session also touched on the need for better socialization and outreach regarding budget discussions. Some community members noted that they found out about the meeting at the last minute and suggested improved coordination to ensure wider participation. Lloyd responded by offering to coordinate further with the Cardano Foundation and other groups to amplify these discussions. Kevin also proposed the idea of holding in-person workshops at major blockchain events to engage more stakeholders in the budget process.

As the meeting wrapped up, the TSC members reiterated their commitment to transparency, open participation, and responsible budget allocation. They encouraged community members to review the proposed projects on the Intersect knowledge base and provide feedback. The tendering process will be designed to ensure fair competition and high-quality development work.

The final message from the TSC was clear: **the process is open, the community is invited to participate, and Cardano’s technical future depends on broad collaboration.** The next steps will involve continued refinement of budget priorities, ongoing community engagement, and further alignment with other committees to ensure a well-structured and effective development plan for 2025.
