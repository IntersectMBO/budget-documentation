## Agenda 1.16.25

* The primary agenda was to discuss readiness for the upcoming reconciliation workshop, including the status of the Hydra tool and strategies to improve DREP participation.
* Discussions also covered the Net Change Limit (NCL) vote's progress and the constitutional review of the NCL, along with updates on smart contract development and vendor proposals.
* The meeting addressed the critical need to define a threshold for proposals to enter the Budget Info Action, brainstormed ways to combat DREP fatigue, and explored leveraging community hubs for engagement.

## Decisions/Actions

\


| Topic                                              | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Action Items                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budget Process & Reconciliation Workshop Readiness | The committee is in the midst of proposal review workshops and preparing for reconciliation. Gov tool polling is on track, and a Hydra-based solution is being developed for reconciliation workshops. The focus for the upcoming workshop (April 10th) is on readiness and filling facilitation gaps. | Surface demo of Hydra-based solution when available.                                                                               |
| DREP & Community Engagement                        | Efforts are ongoing to improve DREP engagement through a unified Luma calendar, proposal review workshops, and outreach plans for the Net Change Limit (NCL) vote. However, DREP participation remains low across all activities.                                                                      | Continue sharing the unified Luma calendar widely. Continue DREP outreach plan to encourage NCL voting and workshop participation. |
| NCL Constitutional Concerns                        | A potential typo in the NCL epoch (603 instead of 604) was raised, which could deem it unconstitutional and further deter DREP participation. The committee is seeking clarification.                                                                                                                  | Lloyd Duhon to check with Thomas Lindseth on the status of the NCL constitutionality assessment.                                   |
| Smart Contract & Back Office Readiness             | Smart contract development is progressing, with an AMA planned for May to finalize outstanding questions. Intersect is also working on back office readiness to integrate with the smart contract framework as an administrator.                                                                       | Schedule AMA session in May to finalize smart contract decisions.                                                                  |
| Vendor Proposals & Tooling Integration             | Approximately 120 vendor proposals have been submitted to Gov tool, with comments and polling live. Committees are beginning to review. While Tempo has read-side integration with Gov tool, Intersect continues to push only Gov tool for voting to prevent fragmentation.                            | Continue monitoring Tempo's integration with Gov tool.                                                                             |
| Reconciliation Workshop Feedback & Adjustments     | Feedback from initial workshops indicated that 5-minute pitches were too short, and DREP attendance was low. The plan for the April 10th workshop was adjusted to have no breakout rooms due to low sign-ups, instead holding discussions in a plenary session. The order of topics was also adjusted. | Update calendar invites for workshops to clearly state pitch duration. Implement plenary session for April 10th workshop.          |
| Addressing DREP Fatigue and Overwhelm              | DREPs are perceived as overwhelmed, leading to disengagement. Suggestions included direct marketing, networking, and potentially simplifying what's asked of DREPs. The idea of "pizza parties" or other incentives for DREP participation was re-surfaced.                                            | Re-surface the idea of DREP incentives (e.g., "pizza parties") to encourage participation.                                         |
| Proposal Edit Lock-Down                            | The fluid nature of proposal edits on Gov tool is hindering DREP review. A hard lock-down date of April 24th for all proposal edits was proposed, with only DREP-requested changes permitted afterward.                                                                                                | Communicate April 24th as the hard lock-down date for all proposal edits.                                                          |
| DREP Compensation Scheme                           | A previous DREP compensation scheme proposal faced pushback and is currently pending further research.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | N/A                                                                                                                                |
| Bundling Governance Actions                        | The committee discussed potentially bundling the Net Change Limit and the Budget Info Action into a single info action to combat DREP fatigue and simplify voting, contingent on its constitutionality.                                                                                                | Investigate the constitutionality and feasibility of bundling the NCL and BIA into one info action.                                |
| TSC & IO Proposal Alignment                        | The existence of similar, potentially competing proposals from TSC and IO creates complexity for DREPs. There's a recognized need for these groups to collaborate or clarify their proposals to streamline DREP decision-making.                                                                       | Encourage dialogue and potential collaboration between TSC and IO to simplify their core proposals for DREPs.                      |
| Budget Info Action Threshold (Ongoing)             | The specific threshold for proposals to be included in the BIA has not yet been finalized. This decision is pending further discussion and the readiness of new tooling.                                                                                                                               | Finalize the threshold for proposals to be included in the Budget Info Action.                                                     |
| Hubs as DREP Engagement Drivers                    | It was suggested that community hubs, which recently received funding from Intersect, could be tasked with engaging DREPs in their regions and incentivizing workshop participation as part of their contractual obligations.                                                                          | Danielle Stanko to surface the idea of leveraging community hubs for DREP engagement.                                              |
