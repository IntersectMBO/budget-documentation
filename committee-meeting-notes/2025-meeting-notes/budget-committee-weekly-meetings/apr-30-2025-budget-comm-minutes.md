## Decisions/Actions



| Topic                                         | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Action Items                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Epoch Selection for Tool Closure              | The committee decided to select the epoch just before the tool closes on May 4th. This ensures results are available promptly for the finalization workshop, avoiding a delay until May 9th. Changes between epochs are minimal (0.3% delta), so the impact on the vote is negligible.                                                                                                    | Confirm May 4th epoch for tool closure.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Info Action Start Date                        | Intersect is targeting readiness for the budget info action immediately after polls close (May 6th), if they are funded. This would mean the info action would begin around May 6th, plus six epochs (approx. 30 days) from the epoch boundary on May 9th. The committee discussed whether to proceed immediately or allow a few days for further discussion.                             | Determine the exact launch date for the budget info action (May 6th or later).                                                                                                             |
| Current Budget Value                          | As of today, the total budget, if polls were to close, would be 241 million ADA, not including the Intersect proposal (which is showing improvement). If Intersect is funded, the total would be around 260 million ADA.                                                                                                                                                                  | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Outreach to DREPs (Utah)                      | Morasaki is reaching out to Utah and other DREPs, acknowledging Golden Week may impact responses. Jack Briggs and Nick Cook are also coordinating outreach to Utah, with Jack clarifying Intersect's budget proposal before speaking to him directly.                                                                                                                                     | Continue coordinated outreach to DREPs, particularly Utah.                                                                                                                                 |
| Intersect's Budget Proposal Clarity           | Jack Briggs is adjusting Intersect's budget proposal on Gov tool and preparing communications to clarify what is changing and that the 20 million ADA requested will likely be less due to live exchange rates. He also plans to stress that the funding is for critical infrastructure and a dependency for the constitution states, not discretionary spending.                         | Jack Briggs to update Intersect's proposal and communications to emphasize critical nature and likely lower realized ADA. Vendors and committee members to support this message.           |
| Governance Support Funding                    | Currently, only 200,000 ADA (from the ADA SAT proposal) is allocated for governance support out of the total budget. This highlights a significant underfunding of governance support by DREPs.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Produce analysis of current funding distribution (e.g., how little is for governance support) and disseminate to the community before May 5th voting closes.                               |
| Multiple Info Actions Strategy                | Adam Rusch proposed doing multiple info actions (e.g., Core, Ecosystem, Supporting) to categorize budget items, aiming for better future processes. Concerns were raised about potential DREP fatigue, diluting the process, and risking smaller projects not passing if separated. The initial plan includes a second info action round if DREPs have the appetite.                      | Further discussion needed on whether to pursue multiple info actions in the first round or stick to a single, omnibus action.                                                              |
| Communication with DREPs                      | The current system lacks good means for DREPs to communicate with each other or for committees to communicate with DREPs securely and safely. This leads to ad-hoc interactions and challenges in reaching top DREPs.                                                                                                                                                                     | Acknowledge the need for improved DREP communication systems for future processes.                                                                                                         |
| Future Budget Process & Retrospective         | The committee aims to develop a new, improved budget proposal process for 2026, learning from current challenges. Retrospective workshops are being planned for June/July, potentially leveraging unused "Voltage Control" contract hours.                                                                                                                                                | Plan and conduct retrospective workshops in June/July to improve the 2026 budget process. Community members encouraged to participate in developing the new process.                       |
| Intersect's Administration Plan (Contingency) | Jack Briggs is currently focusing on securing funding for Intersect and has not fully developed a contingency plan if Intersect's proposal is voted down. He acknowledges the severe implications, including disbanding committees and altered member services. Adam Rusch suggested a statement detailing Intersect's reforms and the allocation, not guaranteed disbursement, of funds. | Jack Briggs to discuss Intersect's reforms and allocation vs. disbursement at the board meeting. Dave Dionisio to share his document on roles, responsibilities, and TSC audits with Jack. |
| Contract Management Process                   | Intersect has identified a single accountable lead for the contract management process. Jack Briggs proposes bringing this lead into status calls for updates and initial feedback from the budget committee and vendors.                                                                                                                                                                 | Jack Briggs to connect the new contract management PM with Marc Gorman and Lloyd Duhon, and integrate them into budget task force meetings.                                                |
