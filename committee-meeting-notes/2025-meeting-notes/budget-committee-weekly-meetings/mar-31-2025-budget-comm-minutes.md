## Agenda 1.16.25

* The meeting began with updates on the budget ratification process, including the imminent launch of vendor proposals on Gov tool and the activation of delegation-weighted voting.
* A key focus was the discussion and recommendation for a virtual-only format for reconciliation workshops, driven by DREP preferences and logistical considerations.
* Attendees also reviewed the proposed process flow for moving proposals to a final budget, along with updates on smart contract development and contingency planning for Net Change Limit scenarios.

## Decisions/Actions

| Topic                                         | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Action Items                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budget Ratification Task Force Updates        | The development team is finalizing QA testing, with plans to launch all 50+ vendor proposals on Gov tool tomorrow (April 1st). More proposals are expected throughout April. Delegation-weighted voting will be enabled soon to allow for temperature testing and polling.                                                  | Launch all proposals on Gov tool by April 1st. Enable delegation-weighted voting on Gov tool.                                         |
| Engagement Roadshow & DREP/Vendor Interaction | A roadshow of engagement is planned to bring DREPs and vendors together for discussions, either directly or through hubs, to foster informed decision-making. Initial sessions are being planned for early April.                                                                                                           | Plan and execute roadshow engagement sessions to connect DREPs and vendors.                                                           |
| Proposal Volume & Reconciliation Workload     | The team needs to estimate the total volume of proposals to assess the workload for reconciliation workshops and the burden on DREPs for review. Cross-referencing proposals submitted via committees versus the new form is also required.                                                                                 | Estimate total proposal volume and assess reconciliation workload. Cross-reference proposals from old and new submission methods.     |
| Confidentiality of Proposals                  | The proposal form includes a confidentiality checkbox for technical changes with major impact (e.g., Security Council). This is not for IP protection of public-funded projects. TSC will verify confidentiality claims related to technology changes.                                                                      | Verify confidentiality claims for proposals, ensuring they relate to technical necessity, not IP protection.                          |
| Reconciliation Workshop Format                | Initial feedback indicated a preference for in-person workshops, but stake-weighted DREP surveys showed a stronger preference for virtual engagement and asynchronous work, especially among top DREPs (1% stake). The recommendation is to proceed with virtual-only workshops.                                            | Formally propose and proceed with planning virtual-only reconciliation workshops. Obtain formal sign-off from the Steering Committee. |
| Process Flow from Proposals to Budgets        | A proposed process flow outlines initial self-tagging of proposals, committee analysis (quality, duplicates, gaps), DREP prioritization using Gov tool/Tempo, and topical workshops in April. Reconciliation workshops will focus on generating a first 70% of easily passable items, with remaining items addressed later. | Continue to refine and communicate the proposed process flow for moving from proposals to a budget.                                   |
| Proposal Submission Deadline                  | The effective deadline for proposals to be considered in this current process is April 24th. Proposals submitted after this date may be considered in future budget cycles.                                                                                                                                                 | Clearly communicate April 24th as the deadline for proposals to be included in the current budget process.                            |
| Other Administrator Proposals                 | The question of whether Intersect's budget action will include proposals managed by other administrators is still under discussion. Currently, Intersect is the primary administrator for received proposals.                                                                                                               | Continue to determine how proposals with other administrators will be handled within the budget process.                              |
| Intersect Administrative Fee                  | The previous 5% administrative fee has been removed. Intersect will now operate on a one-time fee, to be approved by DREPs (e.g., 10 million ADA), covering all associated costs.                                                                                                                                           | N/A                                                                                                                                   |
| Committee Input in Proposal Review            | Committees are expected to add value by reviewing proposals for quality, identifying gaps, and providing unbiased feedback to DREPs. They can also flag inadequate proposals but cannot "hold" them. Their input will be posted as comments on Gov tool.                                                                    | Committees to proactively review proposals, identify gaps, and provide feedback in a standardized format via Gov tool comments.       |
| Smart Contract UI & Analytics Volunteers      | Volunteers from the Budget Committee are requested to help with the UI/UX review of the smart contract interface (for internal users) and a public-facing analytical dashboard being built by Zerus.                                                                                                                        | Volunteers from the Budget Committee to assist with UI/UX review of smart contract interfaces.                                        |
| Net Change Limit (NCL) Discussion             | The ongoing NCL debate includes discussions about two periods (2025/2026) and how a new NCL would replace existing ones. The plain language of the constitution allows only a single NCL at any time.                                                                                                                       | Review the proposed 2026 NCL and prepare for future discussions on NCL strategy.                                                      |
| Meeting Time Zone (UTC vs. BST)               | A discussion is needed to determine a stable meeting time, considering daylight savings and optimal UTC/BST hours, to be decided when more voting members are present.                                                                                                                                                      | Schedule an asynchronous vote or discussion to determine a stable meeting time, including time zone.                                  |
