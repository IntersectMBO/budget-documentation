## Proposal Summary

The proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal period will encompass all funding requests made by the Technical Steering Committee and the Open Source Committee. The primary mandate for the allocation of these requested funds is to ensure that they are dedicated specifically to the ongoing development and maintenance of the Cardano blockchain. This includes not only the enhancement of existing features but also the implementation of new advancements that will contribute to the overall stability, security, and efficiency of the Cardano network. By prioritizing these areas, the committees aim to foster innovation and support the continued growth of the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

The proposed Core Budget is ₳ 125,304,400.  This is to be managed by one Treasury withdrawal action using a smart contract to lock funds until the following dates:

| June 2025:     | ₳ 70,000,000 |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| July 2025      | ₳ 13,000,000 |
| August 2025    | ₳ 13,000,000 |
| September 2025 | ₳ 29,304,400 |

## Technical Steering Committee Proposal

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has put forward the following request and supporting breakdown for the 2025 budget process. To assist in visualizing the TSC proposal, the following breakdown has been put forward, which if necessary, is scalable in part to the approved finalized budget.

The budget breakdown shown below has been created following an analysis of the 2024 spend on core Cardano, engineered for expected changes and growth in 2025.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: the ADA values shown above represent a potential full year funding, this may be scaled in the final budget request
{% endhint %}

The TSC has requested an additional ₳9m as an emergency/contingency fund but notes this may be handled directly by the budget committee, and has not been included in the outline above

With the exception of the Research element under Roadmap, all funding is expected to come from the Core budget. The funding bucket is a consideration of the Budget Committee and not directly from the TSC.

### Potential Roadmap Projects

The following project cards have been submitted by the community and technical working groups and have been triaged through the Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group.

This process reviews and validates the information provided before being included on the following list for community prioritization.

Final selection will be allocated from the categories above, such as ‘roadmap - core roadmap’ and ‘roadmap - research’.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note I: Project cards are regularly updated and subject to change.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note II: Funding is dependent on prioritization, technical readiness and technical programming. No project should assume funding has been agreed at this stage.
{% endhint %}

A project card is designed to hold relevant and useful information for the community to be able to support prioritisation discussions and recommendations.

When a potential project is submitted for review and inclusion to the backlog, we will ask that this information is provided or an explanation as to why it cannot be.This will enable the community to make informed prioritization decisions.

Project cards outline the overall project goal and benefit, as well the likely deliverable(s) to be funded.

It is expected that throughout the duration of this budget that project prioritization may change and that new initiatives and projects may also need to be considered. To be able to factor this in some allocation has been made above to be prioritized at a later date, categories such as ‘Uncommitted -  Uncommitted core development’.

&#x20;

### Technical Steering

Once the goals and the projects have been prioritized then the Technical Steering Committee will recommend how best to implement them and oversee the technical delivery supported by Intersect delivery assurance teams.

The TSC is a rallying point for members, suppliers, and third parties to coordinate the delivery of development services to support the Cardano blockchain. As per the committee remit, the TSC will carry out the following:

* Recommending the execution details of the backlog
* Drafting of milestone deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance for the execution recommendation
* Facilitating a tender/award evaluation process for major contracts with members

Further details on the[ Technical Steering Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee) are available via the knowledge base.

**2025 & 2026 Budgets:** Many of the development projects within the TSC budget require an effort of greater than 6 months. Therefore in order to prevent the risk projects having to start and stop, causing increased costs and delays. The TSC is proposing, where required, to allocate 2026 budget to help improve the certainty required deliver on development projects.

| Budget allocation for 2025    | ₳ 66,128,400   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Budget allocation for 2026    | ₳  35,291,000  |
| Final 2025 Budget proposal    | ₳  101,304,400 |

## Open Source Committee Proposal

The proposal has been put together through community input. (Full list of programs and activities included in this proposal can be found here:[ Open Source Committee](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee))

Approval of these proposals will empower the Cardano community to continue its growth, ensure project sustainability, and maintain the high standards of open-source participation within the Cardano ecosystem.

Receiving funding in accordance with this proposal will enable a wide range of essential initiatives to promote and sustain open-source development within the Cardano ecosystem, as outlined in the[ Paid Open Source Model (POSM) Whitepaper](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/intersecting-open-source-and-sustainability-a-paid-open-source-model-for-ecosystems).

The committee strongly believes that this proposal allows for an expansion of the open source efforts achieved in 2024.

### OSC Proposed Initiatives

* Maintainer Retainer Program: Provides consistent financial support to maintainers of up to 50 repositories, ensuring the stability and ongoing development of key projects, these will be nominated by the community and vetted through an[ incubation program](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/project-incubation-lifecycle-framework) and[ contribution ladder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmfCfVhx-Eb_KGWnCebZk6x-tcIsS23G88hZJW5VEuc/edit?usp=sharing).
* 24/7 Incident Response Team: Funds a dedicated 24/7 team to manage security incidents and ensure rapid response capabilities. (Shared request with TSC)
* Project Support Services: Enhances project compliance, design innovation, and community engagement across Cardano open-source initiatives. OSO & OSC would advise and source providers to assist with Marketing, Community Building, Legal, Open Source Strategy & Sustainability, Governance, Product Management, Design, and Training. See[ OSO Service Catalog](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TOC6GYBplVCEahuHAXiZ2A3RY6MsEE9tqvXgNX571Mc/edit?usp=sharing)
* Summer of Code Equivalent: Supports educational stipends and full-time internships for 20 students (all backgrounds), fostering talent development and expanding the pool of skilled contributors.[ Google - Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) Improves OSO DE\&I
* OSO Community Integration, Events, Tooling: Disbursement to OSO to plan, host, and attend hackathon-like events, Developer Advocate events, miscellaneous tooling, Partnerships and Level 1 & 2 Support Services costs.
* Bug Bounty Program: A bug bounty reward program aimed at rewarding community found incidents for projects under the Intersect github, not specifically limited to “Core Cardano”.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Title</th><th>Description</th><th>ROI</th><th>Total 2025 Expenditure (₳)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Core Maintenance</td><td>Contract Type: From Feb-July this will take the form an engineering call-off agreement for engineering resource up to a maximum of value of $10m IOE. This is due to the fact that without a budget in place it has not been possible to put this work to open tender yet and so the existing IOE maintenance team will continue to be engaged until there is access to the treasury. Once the budget is approved, the ambition of the TSC is that these maintenance work activities will be broken up and put to open tender to the community for the second half of 2025.<br>Hours to be spent on the backlog as reviewed and approved by the Technical Steering Committee. From July onward,<br><br>The full list of work covered under maintenance can be found here: <a href="https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/technical-roadmap/maintenance-items">full list of maintenance items.</a><br></td><td>There are a large number of supportive, maintenance style items required in any given period to keep Cardano running. These have been labelled as maintenance items, although understanding some of the work items outlined do not strictly meet this common definition, it is the most convenient.<br><br>There are significant risks in not having maintenance items and budget for such activity. Without many of these items realistic project or development goals would likely stall. These services are used by projects to test and integrate amongst many other requirements and benefits, many of these elements help to ensure a maintained secure and stable Cardano product.<br><br>The activities under maintenance are listed below. These fall under a single maintenance contract for the next 6 months (Feb-Aug). This is valued at $9.75m. It is assumed that the following six months will be approximitely similar to the first 6 months of 2025.</td><td>₳40,100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Integration &#x26; Rollout</td><td>Integration is defined as the work that is needed to complete development and produce a fully integrated, tested and released version of the node. This work includes benchmarking, post-integration testing, security evaluation, and any changes to documentation. It also includes any fixes/changes that need to be made to the code, and any interfacing to node components. Rollout includes the work that is needed to support new users of the feature, deployment on testnets as necessary, any patches/improvements that need to made to address issues that are found in practical use.<br>eg: Integration of Ouroboros Genesis, Integration of UTxO LMDB, Integration of UTxO LSM</td><td></td><td>Approximitely 35% of total maintenance efforts</td></tr><tr><td>Core Maintenance</td><td>Core maintenance is defined as 'essential ongoing work on the node and associated software that is required to keep the blockchain from degrading'. Core Maintenance is the most essential activity of the core budget. Not having a core maintenance budget would effectively stall any realistic goal or project deployment. It is essential to maintaining a secure and stable end system.<br>e.g: Technical Debt, Bug Fixing, E2E Testing, Security Improvements, Maintenance activities for API, CLI, DB-Sync, Plutus Core etc.</td><td></td><td>Approximitely 40% of total maintenance efforts</td></tr><tr><td>Support</td><td>Support is defined as the activities that are needed to ensure that the node can be built and released in an efficient and secure way. This includes ensuring that any compiler issues that arise during node development are properly handled and that any 3rd party libraries are up-to-date and that any bugs in library code or efficiency issues that impact the node are resolved properly.<br>e.g: Release Management, Haskell Compiler Support, 3rd Party Library Maintenance.</td><td></td><td>Approximitely 15% of total maintenance efforts</td></tr><tr><td>Operational</td><td>Operational costs are defined as the expenses that are incurred through the normal operation of the maintenance process. These include data centre and similar costs.<br>e.g: Operate the bootstrap relay nodes that enable new users to join the network (no longer needed once Ouroboros Genesis has been fully rolled out)., CI/CD Operations (node release), Maintain Testnets.</td><td></td><td>Approximitely 10% of total maintenance efforts</td></tr><tr><td>Community</td><td>Activities specifically related to community engagement eg: Hard Fork Coordination, Product Bug Bounty, Blog posts and other communication activities</td><td></td><td>Approximitely 5% of total maintenance efforts</td></tr><tr><td>AWS Costs</td><td>Amazon Web Services</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Roadmap Development</td><td>Contract Type: Typically these will be a a series of fixed payment milestone contracts with set delivereables and payment on sign off of completion<br><br>This portion of the budget is for Development Projects related to improving and enhancing the core network and aligned to at least one of the Product Committee Goals: 1.

Maintaining Cardano's current qualities</td><td>₳13,566,000</td></tr><tr><td>Midgard Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup [Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Midgard is a layer 2 optimistic rollup for Cardano. It has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions onchain but in a more compact form<br><br>Effort: 1 Year Project to complete with a team of 5-6</td><td>Improving scalability and economic sustainability of Cardano<br><br>This represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent economic security. Instead it maximally inherits the security of Cardano.</td><td>$1,573,000</td></tr><tr><td>Hydra Development [Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Hydra is a L2 scaling solution, an isomorphic multi-party state channel. This enables a fixed set of people to create an off-chain ledger with custom parameters, execute transactions and smart contracts, and only settle agreed upon states, to L1, incrementally and upon closure.<br>Comment</td><td>Hydra heads allow effectively unlimited scaling, and the reduction/removal of friction points that currently restrict adoption, like transaction fees, settlement times etc. Hydra heads benefit from the properties of the Cardano ledger, while allowing customization to application specific requirements.</td><td>$2,288,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ouroboros Leios<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Whereas in a classical blockchain the block bodies directly contain transactions, in Leios the block bodies can also contain references to Endorser Blocks which themselves contain references to so-called Input Blocks containing the actual transactions. Those references are certified through a voting mechanism that guarantees a majority of validators agree on the content of Endorser Blocks.</td><td>Increase transaction throughput on Cardano mainnet by orders of magnitude.</td><td>$2,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ouroboros Peras<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Peras modifies the chain-selection rule to include the “boosting” of the dominant chain's blocks by a quorum of votes from periodic randomly-selected voting committees. It modifies the chain-selection rule, the CDDL of the block body, and the creation, transport, and verification of votes and the certificates that witness a quorum of votes. It adds several new protocol parameters.</td><td>Peras reduces settlement time by orders of magnitude without weakening the existing security guarantees. It is compatible with Leios and Genesis, and does not significantly impact node resources.</td><td>$1,430,000</td></tr><tr><td>Revised Stakepool Incentive Scheme<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>Several proposals have been made to adjust the current stake pool incentives scheme. A particular concern is that of providing smoother incentives for smaller pools. This project will investigate this important issue, considering the merits of existing proposals, identifying possible improvements to the current scheme with costs/benefits, and outlining a development plan if successful.</td><td>The community will benefit from greater diversity in the stake pool offering, with healthier small pools. Stake pools will benefit from fairer treatment.</td><td>$280,000</td></tr><tr><td>Nested Transactions<br>[Recommended for Tender]</td><td>We propose implementing Nested Transactions, a change to the current ledger design to support a specific kind of transaction batching. This design supports swap intents, by allowing individual transactions in a batch to be unbalanced, but the full batch itself must be balanced. We interpret Babel fees as swap intent. We include several related ledger changes for the purpose of demonstrating the extensibility of this framework to support additional kinds of intents, inclusion of which in the production implementation is optional.</td><td>If implemented, this feature will (1) bring in Ada-less users, (2) make multi-user, multi-UTxO asset swaps cheaper, faster, and with less contention (3) be a step towards supporting arbitrary intents</td><td>$715,000</td></tr><tr><td>Further Core Cardano Devlopment Projects as proposed and reviewed by the community</td><td><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/Yzy77cQuAEYNjeNy3YrN/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects">Further Core Development work from proposals submitted by the community: </a><a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/Yzy77cQuAEYNjeNy3YrN/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects">Core Backlog proposals can be found here.</a></td><td></td><td>$2,750,000</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Roadmap Development</td><td><a href="https://technicalsteeringcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/technical-roadmap/potential-roadmap-projects"><br>Contract Type: Typically these will be a a series of fixed payment milestone contracts with set delivereables and payment on sign off of completion<br><br>Community proposed development items that do not directly align with one of the Product Committee Priority Areas, but which deliver high value to the Cardano core infrastructure.
