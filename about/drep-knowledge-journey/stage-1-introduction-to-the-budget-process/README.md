<summary>Leveraging Funds in Voting</summary>

ðŸ”¹ $ADA from budget may be used in voting processes. Intersect currently does not recommend voting with the ADA, and will follow DRep recommendations as to when voting would be appropriate with the ADA withdrawn via treasury action.

ðŸ”¹ Decisions ultimately rest with Intersect members, the DReps, and the Constitutional Committee, keeping power in the hands of the community

<summary>Delegation to SPOs</summary>

ðŸ”¹ Funds received via treasury withdrawal could be delegated to SPOs. A working group will be proposed to determine where (e.g. solo stake pool operators, less than X delegation, more than Y delegation, etc), how long (monthly, quarterly, etc) and how much (5m increments? 10m?)
