# 2025 Budget Process

## Cardano Budget Process 2025

### Overview

Welcome to the official portal for Cardano's 2025 budgeting process. This platform represents a historic milestone as Cardano implements its first annual budget through on-chain governance. The process is facilitated by Intersect, a member-based organization advancing Cardano's development, with final decisions made by the community through on-chain voting.

### Core Principles

Our budget process adheres to the following foundational principles:

* **Constitution Alignment**: Adherence to the interim constitution and Cardano's on-chain governance system
* **Community Interest**: Acting in the interests of both Intersect members and the wider Ada-holding community
* **Facilitation Not Dictation**: Coordinating without controlling outcomes
* **Open Access**: Avoiding gatekeeping of participation, funds, or processes
* **Transparency**: Maintaining open documentation and communication throughout

### Treasury Overview
